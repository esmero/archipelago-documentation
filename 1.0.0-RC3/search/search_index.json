Click here to jump to the Ingesting Both New Digital Objects and Collections section of this guide page. Ingesting Only New Digital Objects From either the main Content page or the AMI Sets List page, select the 'Start an AMI set' button to begin. Step 1: Plugin Selection Select the Plugin type you will be using from the dropdown menu. Google Sheets Importer Spreadsheet Importer (if using local CSV file) *The Remote JSON API Importer and additional remote import source options (for other repository systems) will be covered in separate tutorials following future releases. Step 2: Operation and Spreadsheet Source Selection Select 'Create New ADOs' as the Operation you would like to perform. If using Google Sheets Importer: Enter the ID of your Google Sheet Enter the Cell Range for your Google Sheet If using Spreadsheet Importer: Select 'Choose File' to upload the CSV you will be using. Step 3: Data Transformation Selections Select the data transformation approach--how your source data will be transformed into ADO (Archipelago Digital Object) Metadata. You will have 3 options for your data transformation approach: Direct Columns from your spreadsheet source will be cast directly to ADO metadata (JSON), without transformation/further processing (only intended for use with simple data strings). Custom (Expert Mode) Provides very granular custom data transformation and mapping options Needs to be used if importing Digital Objects and Digital Object Collections at the same time/from same spreadsheet source (see separate instructions below). Template Columns from your spreadsheet source will be cast to ADO metadata (JSON) using a Twig template setup for JSON output. You will also need to Select which columns contain filenames, entities or URLS where files can be fetched from. Select what columns correspond to the Digital Object types found in your spreadsheet source. Lastly, for this step, you will need to select the destination Fields and Bundles for your New ADOs. If your spreadsheet source only contains Digital Objects, select Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) for Digital Object If using Sheet 1 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select Template and use the AMI Ingest JSON template that corresponds with your metadata elements. Select images , documents , and audios for the file source/fetching. Step 4: Global ADO Mappings Select your global ADO mappings. Even if empty (no values), select node_uuid and any relationship predicate columns (such as ismemberof ). By default, the option to automatically assigns UUIDs is selected. If you have existing UUIds, unselect this option. Select the corresponding Columns for the Required ADO mappings. If using Sheet 1 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select both ismemberof and node_uuid for ADO Parent columns Keep 'Automatically assign UUID' checked Do not select any column for 'Sequence' Select the label column for ADO Label Step 5: ZIP upload Provide an optional ZIP file containing your assets. You may choose to upload a ZIP file containing all or some of the corresponding files specified in your csv/spreadsheet. The file upload size restrictions specified in your Archipelago instance will apply here (512MB maximum by default). Please note, when creating your ZIP file (in particular, within an OSX environment): only select the folders and files needed, not the top/enclosing folder they are in. Info Step 6: AMI Set Confirmation You will now see a message letting you know that 'Your source data was saved and is available as a CSV at linktotheAMIgenerated.csv The message will also let you know that your New AMI Set was created and provide a link to the AMI Set page. Step 7: AMI Set Processing Your newly created AMI Set will now need to be Processed. If you clicked on the 'see it here' link in Step 6, you will be brought to the AMI Set page for review. From this page you can review the JSON configuration for your set (determined by your selections in the preceeding steps). To Process this set, navigate to the Process tab. You will have two options related to the Processing outcome for your AMI Set. - Option 1: Select the \"Desired ADOS Statuses After Process\" for both Digital Objects (and Digital Object Collections, if also part of your ingest). - The Statuses you have available will reflect the publication workflow/moderation states (such as Draft, Published, Archived/Unpublished) setup in your Archipelago instance, and the permissions associated your user account. - Option 2: You may choose to check the option to 'Enqueue but do not process Batch' to place the AMI set in the Queue to Process. For the AMI version shipped with Archipelago 1.0.0-RC2, the option to 'Enqueue' for scheduled/future Processing should only be used if the Queue operations for your Archipelago instance are configured. Please return to this page for updated Enqueueing instructions that will accompany future releases. - Select Confirm to continue. You may also select Process from the Operations menu for the AMI set from the main AMI sets page. If you chose to 'Confirm\" and Process your AMI Set immediately, proceed to Step 9: Processing and ADO Creation. Step 8: Queue Manager (if not Processing immediately) If you chose to place your AMI set in the Queue to Process in step 7, you may need to navigate to the Queue Manager found at /admin/config/system/queue-ui . (Be sure to select the Queue Manager under the System section, not the Queue Manager for Hydroponic Service under the Archipelago section). If the Queue operations for your Archipelago instance have been configured, you can simply leave your AMI Set in the Queue for Processing on the preconfigured schedule. To Process your AMI Set immediately from the Queue Manager page, select the checkbox next to the 'AMI Digital Object Ingester Queue Worker'. Keep the Action menu set to Batch Process and click the Apply to selected items button. Step 9: Processing and ADO Creation Your AMI set will now be Processed. You can follow the set's progress through the Processing queues loading screen. After your AMI set is Processed, you will receive confirmation messages letting you know your Digital Objects were successfully created. From this message, you can click on each ADO title to review the new created Digital Object (or Collection) if you wish. Or, you may proceed to step 10. Step 10: Review your newly created Digital Objects Return to the main Content page found at /admin/content and review your newly created Digital Objects. After ensuring that files and metadata elements were mapped correctly, you may choose to change the Status for your Digital Objects to 'Published'. Celebrate your AMI success with a fresh coffee, tea, or cookie! Ingesting Both New Digital Objects and Collections (in the same spreadsheet) From either the main Content page or the AMI Sets List page, select the 'Start an AMI set' button to begin. Steps 1: Plugin Selection & Step 2: Operation and Spreadsheet Source Selection Follow the same instructions found above for Ingesting New Digital Objects. Step 3: Data Transformation Selections To import Digital Objects and Digital Object Collections at the same time/from same spreadsheet source, you will need to select the Custom (Expert Mode) option for your data transformation approach. Custom (Expert Mode) Provides very granular custom data transformation and mapping options You will then need to 'Select your Custom Data Transformation and Mapping Options' for each of your Digital Object types. For Collection objects: Select either the Direct or Template (and corresponding JSON template) option for your data transformation approach. Select the destination Fields and Bundles for Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) for Digital Object Collection You may also wish to Select which columns contain filenames, entities or URLS where files can be fetched from. For most Collection objects, you will either leave unselected or choose images if you are uploading a thumbnail image for your Collection. For each Digital Object type in your spreadsheet source: You will also need to select either the Direct or Template (and corresponding JSON template) option for your data transformation approach. Then select which columns contain filenames, entities or URLS where files can be fetched from. Select what columns correspond to the Digital Object types found in your spreadsheet source. Then Select the destination Fields and Bundles for Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) for Digital Object For example, for Book type Digital Objects, you would select the following options (as depicted in this screenshot): If using Sheet 2 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Follow the instructions for mapping the Digital Object Collection (found in row 2), using the Template Data transformation approach with the AMI 1.0.0-RC1 JSON Template. Also select the destination Fields and Bundles for Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) for Digital Object Collection . Leave the file source fetching unselected. For the Book, Photograph, and Conversation (Oral History) Digital Object types, choose the same the Template Data transformation approach with the AMI 1.0.0-RC1 JSON Template. For Book object types, select images and documents for file source fetching. For Photograph object types, select images for file source fetching. For Conversation (Oral History) object types, select images , documents , and audio for file source fetching. Step 4: Global ADO Mappings Select your global ADO mappings. Even if empty (no values), select node_uuid . In order to make sure that Digital Objects containing the corresponding UUID or spreadsheet row number for any corresponding Collections, make sure ismemberof is also selected in the ADO Parent Columns. By default, the option to automatically assigns UUIDs is selected. If you have existing UUIds, unselect this option. Select the corresponding Columns for the Required ADO mappings. If using Sheet 2 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select both ismemberof and node_uuid for ADO Parent columns Keep 'Automatically assign UUID' checked Do not select any column for 'Sequence' Select the label column for ADO Label Step 5-10: Follow the same instructions found in Steps 5-10 above. As part of step 10, make sure your Digital Objects were ingested into the corresponding Collections you mapped them to in your spreadsheet source. Please note, you will need to Publish the Digital Objects before the Objects will appear in the Collection's View page (whether accessed as a logged-in Admin user or Anonymous/Public user).

We ask that all community members adhere to the following expectations: METRO and Archipelago have a zero-tolerance policy for verbal, physical, and sexual harassment. Anyone who is asked to stop a hostile or harassing behavior is expected to do so immediately. Here , for reference, are New York State\u2019s requirements. Harassment includes: Offensive verbal comments related to sex, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion; sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participation in discussions and activities should be respectful at all times. Please refrain from making inappropriate comments. Create opportunities for all people to speak, exercising tolerance of the perspectives and opinions of others. When we disagree, we do this in a polite and professional manner. We may not always agree. When frustrated, we back away and look for good intentions, not reasons to be more frustrated. When we see a flaw in a contribution, we offer guidance on how to fix it.

Step 1: Plugin Selection Select the Islandora 7 Solr Importer from the dropdown menu. Step 2, section 1: Solr Server Configuration You will only have the option to select 'Create New ADOs' as the Operation you would like to perform. For the Solr Server Configuration section, you will need to provide all of the following information: PID of the Islandora Collection Members you want to fetch (example: islandora:root) Host of your Solr Server (example: repositorydomain.org) Port (example: 8080) Path (example: /) Type of Solr Deployment Either Single Solr Server (most common) or Solr Cloud Ensemble Core (example: islandora) You will also need to select Starting Row you would like to begin fetching results from, and the Number of Rows to fetch. The Starting Row is an offset and defaults to 0, which is the most common (and recommended) approach. For the Total Number of Rows to Fetch, setting this to empty or null will automatically (refresh when selecting 'Next' button at bottom of page) prefill with the real Number Rows found by the Solr Query invoked. If you set this number higher than the actual results we will only fetch what can be fetched. For larger collections, you may wish to create multiple/split AMI ingest sets by selecting a specified number of rows. As an example, for a collection of 1500 objects that you wanted to split into three AMI ingests of 500 objects, you would specify the Starting Row as 0 for the first set and Number of Rows as 500. For the second set, your Starting Row would be Row 501; for the third set, 1001). In this example, the Number of Rows would always be 500. Step 2, section 2: Islandora Mappings In this step you will need to make determinations on how you would like to map your Islandora 7 digital objects to your Archipelago repository. Selecting \"Collapse Multi Children Objects\" will collapse Children Datastreams into a single ADO with many attached files (single row in the generated AMI set .csv file). Book Pages will be fetched but also the Top Level PDF (if one exists in your Islandora instance). In the Required ADO mappings, you will need to specify which Archipelago type you want to map each Islandora Content Model found in your source collection. For example, for info:fedora/islandora:sp_large_image_cmodel you may want to use Photograph . If you had left \"Collapse Multi Children Objects\" unselected, you will also need to specify the Islandora Content Model to ADO types mapping for possible Children. You can also specify an ADO (Object or Collection) to be used the Parent of Imported Objects. By selecting an existing ADO (Object or Collection) here using the autocomplete/search, the generated AMI set .csv file will contain an 'ismemberof' column containing the UUID of the selected ADO for every row. Step 3: Data Transformation Selections Select the data transformation approach--how your source data will be transformed into ADO (Archipelago Digital Object) Metadata. As noted in the list below, 'Custom (Expert Mode)' is the recommended choice for AMI sets generated using the Islandora 7 Solr Impoter plugin. You will have 3 options for your data transformation approach: Direct Columns from your spreadsheet source will be cast directly to ADO metadata (JSON), without transformation/further processing (only intended for use with simple data strings). Custom (Expert Mode) Recommended choice for AMI sets generated using the Islandora 7 Solr Importer plugin Provides very granular custom data transformation and mapping options Needs to be used if importing Digital Objects and Digital Object Collections at the same time/from same spreadsheet source (see separate instructions below). Template Columns from your spreadsheet source will be cast to ADO metadata (JSON) using a Twig template setup for JSON output. You will also need to Select which columns contain filenames, entities or URLS where files can be fetched from. Select what columns correspond to the Digital Object types found in your spreadsheet source. Lastly, for this step, you will need to select the destination Fields and Bundles for your New ADOs. If your spreadsheet source only contains Digital Objects, select Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) for Digital Object If using Sheet 1 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select Template and use the AMI Ingest JSON template that corresponds with your metadata elements. Select images , documents , and audios for the file source/fetching. Step 4: Global ADO Mappings Select your global ADO mappings. Even if empty (no values), select node_uuid and any relationship predicate columns (such as ismemberof ). By default, the option to automatically assigns UUIDs is selected. If you have existing UUIds, unselect this option. Select the corresponding Columns for the Required ADO mappings. If using Sheet 1 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select both ismemberof and node_uuid for ADO Parent columns Keep 'Automatically assign UUID' checked Do not select any column for 'Sequence' Select the label column for ADO Label Step 5: ZIP upload For standard Spreadsheet or Google Sheets AMI ingests, you would use this step to provide an optional ZIP file containing your assets. For your Islandora 7 Solr Importer process, the generated AMI set .csv file will contain the necessary URLs to the corresponding Islandora 7 file datastreams for each object as needed. Select next to skip this ZIP upload step and proceed. Step 6: Batch fetching from Solr During this step, AMI will fetch the specified digital objects from the remote Solr source. This is generally a quick process, but be aware that settings in the remote Solr source can impact the response time. Step 7: AMI Set Confirmation You will now see a message letting your know your \"New AMI Set was created\". You will be able to review the generated .csv file directly from this page under Source Data File. While you may immediately select \"Process\" from this AMI Set Confirmation page to use the Islandora 7 Importer generated .csv file as-is to ingest the ADOs in your AMI set, it is strongly recommended that you review the .csv file first. AMI is configured to trim unecessary (for Archipelago) and de-duplicate redundant Solr source data, but you may wish to pare down the sourced data even further and/or conduct general metadata review and cleanup before migrating your content. You will also likely want to make adjustments to your AMI Ingest JSON Template based on your review, depending on the variation of metadata columns/keys found in your source repostiory. Step 8: AMI Set Processing Whether you have chosen to review your .csv file or not, your newly created AMI Set will now need to be Processed. On the main AMI set page, you can review the configurations and Source Data File for your set (determined by your selections in the preceeding steps). To Process this set, navigate to the Process tab. You will have two options related to the Processing outcome for your AMI Set. Option 1: Select the \"Desired ADOS Statuses After Process\" for both Digital Objects (and Digital Object Collections, if also part of your ingest). The Statuses you have available will reflect the publication workflow/moderation states (such as Draft, Published, Archived/Unpublished) setup in your Archipelago instance, and the permissions associated your user account. Option 2: You may choose to check the option to 'Enqueue but do not process Batch' to place the AMI set in the Queue to Process. For the AMI version shipped with Archipelago 1.0.0-RC2, the option to 'Enqueue' for scheduled/future Processing should only be used if the Queue operations for your Archipelago instance are configured. Please return to this page for updated Enqueueing instructions that will accompany future releases. Select Confirm to continue. You may also select Process from the Operations menu for the AMI set from the main AMI sets page. If you chose to 'Confirm\" and Process your AMI Set immediately, proceed to Step 9: Processing and ADO Creation. Step 9: Queue Manager (if not Processing immediately) If you chose to place your AMI set in the Queue to Process in step 7, you may need to navigate to the Queue Manager found at /admin/config/system/queue-ui . (Be sure to select the Queue Manager under the System section, not the Queue Manager for Hydroponic Service under the Archipelago section). If the Queue operations for your Archipelago instance have been configured, you can simply leave your AMI Set in the Queue for Processing on the preconfigured schedule. To Process your AMI Set immediately from the Queue Manager page, select the checkbox next to the 'AMI Digital Object Ingester Queue Worker'. Keep the Action menu set to Batch Process and click the Apply to selected items button. Step 10: Processing and ADO Creation Your AMI set will now be Processed. You can follow the set's progress through the Processing queues loading screen. After your AMI set is Processed, you will receive confirmation messages letting you know your Digital Objects were successfully created. From this message, you can click on each ADO title to review the new created Digital Object (or Collection) if you wish. Or, you may proceed to step 10. Step 11: Review your newly created Digital Objects Return to the main Content page found at /admin/content and review your newly created Digital Objects. After ensuring that files and metadata elements were mapped correctly, you may choose to change the Status for your Digital Objects to 'Published'.

AMI also enables you to perform batch administrative actions, such as updating, patching/revising, or deleting digital objects and collections. AMI's Solr Importer plugin can be used to create AMI ingests and migrating content from existing Solr-sourcable digital repositories (such as Islandora 7). Getting started with AMI You can access AMI through the AMI Sets tab on the main Content page found at /admin/content or directly at /amiset/list . AMI Overview and Pre-Release Notes - AMI 0.1.0 (Archipelago - 1.0.0-RC3) From the desk of Diego Pino AMI provides Tabulated data ingest for ADOs with customizable input plugins. Each Spreadsheet (or Google Spreadsheet) goes through a Configuration Multi Step setup and generates at the end an AMI Set. AMI Sets then can be enqueued or directly ingested, its generated Objects purged and reingested again, its source data (generated and enriched with UUIDS) CSV replaced, improved and uploaded again and ingested. Click to read the full AMI 0.1.0 (Archipelago - 1.0.0-RC3) Pre-Release Notes. Setup Steps AMI has Ingest, Update and Patch capabilities. AMI has a plugin system to fetch data. The data can come from multiple sources and right now (RC2) CSV/EXCEL or Google Spreadsheets are the ones enabled. Direct from Solr/OAI/API is on the works too for RC3. AMI can read files locally from the server, remotely from URLs or remotely from Private Backend Storage (S3). It does parent/children validation, makes sure that parents are ingested first, cleans broken relationships, allows arbitrary multi relations to be generated in a single ROW (ismemberof, partOf, etc) pointing to other rows or existing ADOs (via UUIDs) and can process rows directly as JSON or preprocessed via a Metadata Display entity (twig template) capable of producing JSON output. These templates can be configured by \u201ctype\u201d, Articles v/s 3DModel can have different ones. Even which columns contain Files can be configured at that level. AMI Set Entity Ami Sets are special custom entities that hold an Ingest Strategy generated via the previous Setup steps (as JSON with all it's settings), a CSV with data imported from the original source (with UUIDs prepopulated if they were not provided by the user). These AMI sets are simpler and faster than \u201cbatch sets\u201d because they do not have a single entry per Object to be ingested. All data lives in a CSV. This means the CSV of an AMI set can be corrected and reuploaded. Users can then Process a Set either putting the to be ingested ADOs in the queue and let Hydroponics Service do the rest or directly via Batch on the UI. ADOs generated by a set can also be purged from there. These sets can also be created manually if needed of any of the chosen settings modified anytime. Which AMI set generated the Ingest is also tracked in a newly created ADO\u2019s JSON and any other extra data (or fixed data e.g common Rights statements, or LoD) can be provided by a Twig Template. Ingest is amazingly fast. We monitored Ingest with Remote URL(islandora Datastreams) files of 15Mbytes average at a speed of 2 seconds per Object (including all post processing) continuously for a set of 100+. Search and Replace This module also provides a simple search/replace text VBO action (handles JSON as text) and a full blown JSONPATCH VBO action to batch modify ADOs. The last one is extremely powerful permitting multiple operations at the same time with tests. E.g replace a certain value, add another value, remove another value only if a certain test (e.g \u201ctype\u201d:\u201dArticle\u201d and \u201cdate_of_digital\u201d: \u201c2020-09-09\u201d) matches. If any tests fail the whole operation will be canceled for that ADO. An incomplete \u201cWebform\u201d VBO action is present but not fully functional yet. This one allows you to choose a Webform, a certain element inside that Webform and then find and replace using the same Interface you would see while editing/adding a new ADO via the web form workflow. Should be ready by RC3. Please be aware that the version of AMI shipped with Archipelago 1.0.0-RC3 provides much of the core batch functions useful for getting started working with large amounts of content, but is not the full or final version of this module. This documentation page will be updated with successive AMI and Archipelago releases. Getting started with AMI You can access AMI through the AMI Sets tab on the main Content page found at /admin/content or directly at /amiset/list . Google Sheets API Congifuration If you plan on using the Google Sheets Importer option, you will need to Configure the Google Sheets API . Example Spreadsheet/CSV This spreadsheet can be used to import a small set of Digital Objects using the same assets part of the Two-Step Demo content ingest guide (these objects can also be found in the Archipelago Deployment repository ). https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IAgDZ1_fGVd_2g1GyUYs0SrnkAfvVtTwukEaIEny5Y/edit?usp=sharing To use this spreadsheet, you can either download as a CSV file to use with the Spreadsheet Importer, or make a copy of this using your configured Google Sheets API account . Example JSON template This JSON template can be used during the Data Transformation (step 3) of your AMI Import. This particular template corresponds with the metadata elements found in the Default Descriptive Metadata and Default Digital Object Collection webforms shipped with Archipelago 1.0.0-RC3. Click to view the example 1.0.0-RC3 AMI JSON template To use this template, copy and paste the JSON below directly into a new Metadata Display, found here for a local http://localhost:8001/metadatadisplay/list or http://yoursite.org/metadatadisplay/list .

For most standard AMI ingests, each Row of your spreadsheet/CSV will correspond to a single Digital Object or Collection. Columns in your spreadsheet/CSV can be mapped to different data (files) and metadata elements (label, description, subjects, etc.). It is recommended that different types of files are placed into separate columns--\"images\", \"documents\", \"models\", \"videos\", \"audios\", \"text\". Filepaths can point to remote files, to existing files within your docker container, s3 (or other storage type/location that is accessible to Archipelago), and to paths within zip files. Example path for existing file within docker container: /var/www/html/d8content/myAMIimage.jpg Example s3 path: s3://myAMIuploads/myAMIdocument.pdf Example remote filepath: https://dogsaregreat.edu/dogs.tiff Multiple files (of the same type) can be placed in a single cell, separated by a semicolon ( ; ). For Digital Objects comprised of multiple types of files, such as an Oral History Interview with an audio file and a PDF transcript file, you can place different file types within different corresponding columns for the same Row. It is recommended that filepaths are copied/stored as plain (non hyperlinked) formatted text. Every spreadsheet/CSV file should contain the following Columns: type the Digital Object or Digital Object Collection Type, such as 'Photograph' or 'Collection' label the title of the Digital Object or Collection Soft-requirement node_uuid this can be empty if empty, Archipelago will automatically generate UUIDs can be used with existing UUIDs during migrations Recommended Columns: Files as defined above \"images\", \"documents\", \"models\", \"videos\", \"audios\", \"text\" .warc/.wacz files should be placed in a column \"upload_associated_warcs\" ismemberof and/or ispartof (and/or whatever predicate corresponds with the relationship you are mapping) these columns can be used to connect related objects using the object-to-object relationship that matches your needs these columns can hold 3 types of values empty (no value) an integer to connect an object to another object's corresponding row in the same spreadsheet/CSV Ex: Row 2 corresponds to a Digital Object Collection; for a Digital Object corresponding to Row 3, the 'ismemberof' column contains a value of '2'. The Digital Object in Row 3 would be ingested as a member of the Digital Object Collection in Row 2. a UUID to connect with an already ingested object Metadata - for all the rich, detailed information associated with your Digital Objects and Collections Every Column header will become a JSON Key and each cell a JSON value for that Key You can use direct JSON snippets such as: [{ \"uri\" : \"http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh95008857\" , \"label\" : \"Digital libraries\" }] - If you have an advanced twig template with the necessary logic, you can place data in cells that can be parsed and structured in various ways (such as multiple values separated by semicolons split accordingly, capitalization of values based on defined patterns, etc.) Ingesting New Digital Objects using Spreadsheets or Google Sheets Click to view Instructions From either the main Content page or the AMI Sets List page, select the 'Start an AMI set' button to begin. Step 1: Plugin Selection Select the Plugin type you will be using from the dropdown menu. Google Sheets Importer Spreadsheet Importer (if using local CSV file) *The Remote JSON API Importer and additional remote import source options (for other repository systems) will be covered in separate tutorials following future releases. Step 2: Operation and Spreadsheet Source Selection Select 'Create New ADOs' as the Operation you would like to perform. If using Google Sheets Importer: Enter the ID of your Google Sheet Enter the Cell Range for your Google Sheet If using Spreadsheet Importer: Select 'Choose File' to upload the CSV you will be using. Step 3: Data Transformation Selections Select the data transformation approach--how your source data will be transformed into ADO (Archipelago Digital Object) Metadata. You will have 3 options for your data transformation approach: Direct Columns from your spreadsheet source will be cast directly to ADO metadata (JSON), without transformation/further processing (only intended for use with simple data strings). Custom (Expert Mode) Provides very granular custom data transformation and mapping options Needs to be used if importing Digital Objects and Digital Object Collections at the same time/from same spreadsheet source (see separate instructions below). Template Columns from your spreadsheet source will be cast to ADO metadata (JSON) using a Twig template setup for JSON output. You will also need to Select which columns contain filenames, entities or URLS where files can be fetched from. Select what columns correspond to the Digital Object types found in your spreadsheet source. Lastly, for this step, you will need to select the destination Fields and Bundles for your New ADOs. If your spreadsheet source only contains Digital Objects, select Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) for Digital Object If using Sheet 1 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select Template and use the AMI Ingest JSON template that corresponds with your metadata elements. Select images , documents , and audios for the file source/fetching. Step 4: Global ADO Mappings Select your global ADO mappings. Even if empty (no values), select node_uuid and any relationship predicate columns (such as ismemberof ). By default, the option to automatically assigns UUIDs is selected. If you have existing UUIds, unselect this option. Select the corresponding Columns for the Required ADO mappings. If using Sheet 1 of the Demo AMI Ingest set (found above): Select both ismemberof and node_uuid for ADO Parent columns Keep 'Automatically assign UUID' checked Do not select any column for 'Sequence' Select the label column for ADO Label Step 5: ZIP upload Provide an optional ZIP file containing your assets. You may choose to upload a ZIP file containing all or some of the corresponding files specified in your csv/spreadsheet. The file upload size restrictions specified in your Archipelago instance will apply here (512MB maximum by default). Please note, when creating your ZIP file (in particular, within an OSX environment): only select the folders and files needed, not the top/enclosing folder they are in. Click to view screenshot of example ZIP file creation in OSX Step 6: AMI Set Confirmation You will now see a message letting you know that 'Your source data was saved and is available as a CSV at linktotheAMIgenerated.csv The message will also let you know that your New AMI Set was created and provide a link to the AMI Set page. Step 7: AMI Set Processing Your newly created AMI Set will now need to be Processed. If you clicked on the 'see it here' link in Step 6, you will be brought to the AMI Set page for review. From this page you can review the JSON configuration for your set (determined by your selections in the preceeding steps). To Process this set, navigate to the Process tab. You will have two options related to the Processing outcome for your AMI Set. Option 1: Select the \"Desired ADOS Statuses After Process\" for both Digital Objects (and Digital Object Collections, if also part of your ingest). The Statuses you have available will reflect the publication workflow/moderation states (such as Draft, Published, Archived/Unpublished) setup in your Archipelago instance, and the permissions associated your user account. Option 2: You may choose to check the option to 'Enqueue but do not process Batch' to place the AMI set in the Queue to Process. For the AMI version shipped with Archipelago 1.0.0-RC3, the option to 'Enqueue' for scheduled/future Processing should only be used if the Queue operations for your Archipelago instance are configured. Please return to this page for updated Enqueueing instructions that will accompany future releases. Select Confirm to continue. You may also select Process from the Operations menu for the AMI set from the main AMI sets page. If you chose to 'Confirm\" and Process your AMI Set immediately, proceed to Step 9: Processing and ADO Creation. Step 8: Queue Manager (if not Processing immediately) If you chose to place your AMI set in the Queue to Process in step 7, you may need to navigate to the Queue Manager found at /admin/config/system/queue-ui . (Be sure to select the Queue Manager under the System section, not the Queue Manager for Hydroponic Service under the Archipelago section). If the Queue operations for your Archipelago instance have been configured, you can simply leave your AMI Set in the Queue for Processing on the preconfigured schedule. To Process your AMI Set immediately from the Queue Manager page, select the checkbox next to the 'AMI Digital Object Ingester Queue Worker'. Keep the Action menu set to Batch Process and click the Apply to selected items button. Step 9: Processing and ADO Creation Your AMI set will now be Processed. You can follow the set's progress through the Processing queues loading screen. After your AMI set is Processed, you will receive confirmation messages letting you know your Digital Objects were successfully created. From this message, you can click on each ADO title to review the new created Digital Object (or Collection) if you wish. Or, you may proceed to step 10. Step 10: Review your newly created Digital Objects Return to the main Content page found at /admin/content and review your newly created Digital Objects. After ensuring that files and metadata elements were mapped correctly, you may choose to change the Status for your Digital Objects to 'Published'.

(What happens with those fishtanks?) A few Event Subscribers/Data describing logics happen in a certain order: User Uploads via a webform Element a new File or via Drush/Batch ingest that attaches (via JSONAPI) a file. If the webform is involved, Archipelago acts quickly and calls directly (before the Node even exists) the file classifier, that will: Add/complement a as:somefiletype JSON structure into the main ADO SBF JSON , with info about the file, checksums, size, Drupal fids, uuid, etc. This is a heavy function part of the StrawberryfieldFilePersisterService . It does a lot, making use of optimized logic, but may do more in the future to handle too-many/too-big files needs (FYI: solution will be simple, add to a queue and process later). The most (yes) important info added here is the desired future storage location of the file. The user finishes the form, saves and and confirms the ADO creation, and finally all the Node events fire. On presave StrawberryfieldEventPresaveSubscriberAsFileStructureGenerator runs and checks if 2.1 already was processed. This is needed since the user could have triggered an ingest via drush/JSONAPI/Webhooks etc. If all is well (this is a less expensive check) Archipelago continues. On presave (next) StrawberryfieldEventPresaveSubscriberFilePersister runs, checking all TEMPORARY files described in as:somefiletype and actually copying them to the right \"desired\" location. And on Save StrawberryfieldEventInsertFileUsageUpdater also marking the file as \"being\" used by a Strawberry driven Node (different Event). Note: Anytime we remove directly from the raw JSON a full as:somefiletype structure of a sub-element from an as:structure we force Archipelago to do all the above again, and Archipelago can regenerate technical metadata. This has been used when updating EXIF binaries or even when something went wrong (while testing, but this stuff is safe no worries). Eventually, there will be a BIG red button that does that if you do not like JSON editing.

If the webform is involved, Archipelago acts quickly and calls directly (before the Node even exists) the file classifier, that will: Add/complement a as:somefiletype JSON structure into the main ADO SBF JSON , with info about the file, checksums, size, Drupal fids, uuid, etc. This is a heavy function part of the StrawberryfieldFilePersisterService . It does a lot, making use of optimized logic, but may do more in the future to handle too-many/too-big files needs (FYI: solution will be simple, add to a queue and process later). The most (yes) important info added here is the desired future storage location of the file. The user finishes the form, saves and and confirms the ADO creation, and finally all the Node events fire. On presave StrawberryfieldEventPresaveSubscriberAsFileStructureGenerator runs and checks if 2.1 already was processed. This is needed since the user could have triggered an ingest via drush/JSONAPI/Webhooks etc. If all is well (this is a less expensive check) Archipelago continues. On presave (next) StrawberryfieldEventPresaveSubscriberFilePersister runs, checking all TEMPORARY files described in as:somefiletype and actually copying them to the right \"desired\" location. And on Save StrawberryfieldEventInsertFileUsageUpdater also marking the file as \"being\" used by a Strawberry driven Node (different Event). Note: Anytime we remove directly from the raw JSON a full as:somefiletype structure of a sub-element from an as:structure we force Archipelago to do all the above again, and Archipelago can regenerate technical metadata. This has been used when updating EXIF binaries or even when something went wrong (while testing, but this stuff is safe no worries). Eventually, there will be a BIG red button that does that if you do not like JSON editing.

But how do you create and enable these Display Modes in the first place? Let's find out. Adding a new Form Mode Why would you want to create a new form mode? One common reason is to create different data entry experiences for users with different roles. Let's create an example form mode called \"Student Webform\" -- we can imagine a deployment where Students need a simplified form for ADO creation. We are going to create a form mode, enable it for Digital Objects, and give it some custom settings that differentiate it from existing form modes. Navigate to yoursite/admin/structure/display-modes Click on Form modes. This image shows the basic Form Modes shipped with Archipelago Click the \"Add Form mode\" button at the top of the page. Then select the \"Content\" entity type from the list. In this example, we ultimately want the form mode to be applied to Archipelago Digital Objects, which is a Content entity type. Enter the name of your Form Mode and hit save. Here we are entering \"Student Webform\". Great. Now you will see your new Form mode in the list! Let's put it to use. Head to yoursite/admin/structure/types/manage/digital_object and click the \"Manage Form Display\" tab. As mentioned above, in this example we want to add a new Form Mode for ADOs, so we are dealing with the Digital Object content type. Scroll to the bottom of this page and look for the \"Custom Display Settings\" area, which is collapsed by default. Expand it, and you should see this. Enable \"Student Webform\" and hit save! Now scroll back up the page. You'll see it enabled like so. Now select our new \"Student Webform\" tab. From here, you have many options and can configure input fields as you see fit! To finish out our specific example though, let's finally add our Student Webform to the display. Click on the settings gear icon next to the Descriptive Metadata field. You'll see that the default webform named \"Descriptive Metadata\" is entered. To add custom content to this Field Widget, start typing in the autocomplete. This example assumes you've created a webform called Student Webform in yoursite/admin/structure/webform . For info on how to create a new Webform with proper settings, see our Webforms as input guide . After you've selected your \"Student Webform\" in the Field Widget setting, hit Update, and then Save at the bottom of the page. All done! So let's recap. We created a new form mode. We added this form mode to the Manage Form Display > Custom Display Settings options for Digital Objects. And finally we configured the Field Widget for Descriptive Metadata in our new Form Mode to use a new Webform. This last step is arbitrary to this example. We could have enabled or disabled fields, or changed other field widget settings depending on our needs. But configuring different Webforms as Field Widgets for Descriptive Metadata is a common use case in Archipelago. Thanks for reading this far! But there is more. We might want to display, in addition to ingest, our ADOs in custom ways. The process for creating new View Modes (the other type of Display Mode) is quite similar to creating new Form Modes, but let's walk through it with another example case. Adding a new View Mode Why would you want to create a new View Mode? Maybe there is a new type of media you are attaching to ADOs that you want to display using the proper player or tool. Or maybe you want to simplify the ADO display, removing fields from the display page. In this example let's create a new View Mode for ADOs that adds some fields to the display to show the Author and Published date of the object. Navigate to yoursite/admin/structure/display-modes Select View modes, and click the \"Add View mode\" at the top of the page. Select Content as your entity type. Enter the name of your new View Mode and save. Ours is \"Digital Object with Publishing Information\" Now let's enable this View mode. Go to yoursite/admin/structure/types/manage/digital_object and click the \"Manage Display\" tab. Scroll to the bottom of the page and expand the \"Custom Display Settings\" area. You will see our newly created View Mode. Enable it and hit save. Now scroll back to the page top. You will see \"Digital Object with Publishing Information\" in the list of View Modes, so go ahead and select it. Scroll down until you see the \"Disabled\" section. This section contains fields that are available to the ADO content type, but are not enabled in this display mode. Let's enable Author and Post date by changing the \"Region\" column dropdown from \"Disabled\" to \"Content\". (To learn more about Regions in Drupal, see here). Basically, this ensures that this field has a home in the page layout. Hit save. Now, if you want ADOs to use this View Mode for display, there is one last step. You need to select \"Digital Object with Publishing Info\" as the view mode Display Settings when adding new content. This area is located on the right side of the page. See below: Now, when we view the individual ADO, these new fields have been added to the display. All done! This was quite a simple example, but now you are aware of how to customize your own ADO display. It can only get more complex and exciting from here. Let's recap. We created a new View Mode. We enabled this View Mode in Manage Display > Custom Display Settings for Digital Objects. We enabled new fields (in this case, just for instruction, the Author and Post date fields) to make our new View Mode unique, and learned about Disabled fields in the process. We selected our new View Mode in the Display Settings area (slightly confusing wording because yes, this is a View Mode, subset of Display Mode) during ADO creation (for more on creating new objects, see this guide ).

Great! So what now? It is time to give your new repository a try and we feel the best way is to start by ingesting a simple Digital Object. Note: This guide will assume Archipelago is running on http://localhost:8001 , so if you wizardly deployed everything in a different location, please replace all URIs with your own setup while following this guide. Requirements Running Archipelago (http://localhost:8001) 20 minutes of your time. Open Mind. Welcome! Start by opening http://locahost:8001 in your favourite Web Browser. Your Demo deployment will have a fancy Home page with some banners and a small explanation of what Archipelago is and can do. Feel free to read through that now or later. Click on Log in in the top left corner and use your demo credentials from the deployment guide. user: demo pass: demo (or whatever password you decided was easy for you to remember during the deployment phase) Press the Log in button. Great, welcome demo user! This users has limited credentials and uses the same global theme as any anonymous user would. Still, demo can create content, so let's use those super powers and give that a try. You will see a new Menu item on the top, black, navigation bar named Add Content . Click it! Brief Background As you already know Archipelago is build on Drupal 8/9 , a very extensible CMS . In practice that means you have (at least) the same functionality any Drupal deployment has and that is also true for Content Managment. Drupal ships by default with a very flexible Content Entity Type named Node . Nodes are used for creating Articles and simple Pages but also in Archipelago as Digital Objects . Drupal has a pretty tight integration with Nodes and that means you get a lot of fun and useful functionality by default by using them. Want to know more about Entities? An Article and a Digital Object are both of type Nodes , but each one represents a different Content Type . Content Types are also named Bundles . An individual Content, like \"Black and White photograph of a kind Dog\" is named a Content Entity or more specific in this case a Node . What have Article and Digital Object Content types in common and what puts the apart? Each Content Type or Bundle has a set of Base Fields and also user configurable set of Fields attached (or bundled together). E.g Article has a title, a Body and the option to add an image. Digital Object has a title but also a special, very flexible one named Strawberry Field (more about that later). Fields are where you put your data into and also where your data comes from when you expose it to the world. Nodes , as any other Content entity have Base Fields (which means you can't remove or configure them) that are used all over the place. Good examples are the title and also the owner, named uid (you!). Other Fields, specific to a Content Type, can be added and configured per Bundle. A Field Widget is used to input data into a Field. Each field can have a Field Formatter that allows you to setup how it is displayed to the World. A set of Field Formatters (the way you want to show your content formatted to the world) is named a Display Mode . You can have many, create new ones and remove them, but only use one at the time. A set of Field Widgets (the way you want to Create and Edit a Node ) is named a Form Mode . You can also have many, create new ones but only use one at the time. Each Content Type can have different Permissions (using the build in User Roles system). Each Content Type can have one or more Display Modes . In Practice this means Display Modes are attached to Content Types . Each display modes can have its own Permissions Each Content Type can have one or more Form Modes . In Practice this means Form Modes are attached to Content Types . Each Form Mode can have its own Permissions. There is of course a lot more to Nodes, Content Types, Formatters, Widgets and in general Content Entities but this is a good start to understand what will happen next. Adding Content Below you see all the Content Types defined by default in Archipelago. Let's click on Digital Object to get your first Digital Object Node. My Metadata What you see below is a Form Mode in action. A multi-step Webform that will ingest metadata into a field of type Strawberry Field (where all the magic happens) attached to that field using a Webform Field Widget , an editorial/advanced Block on the right side and a Workflow/state drop down ( Save as ) at the bottom. Let's fill out the form to begin our ingest. We recommend to use similar values as the ones shown in the screen capture to make following the tutorial easier. Make sure you select Photograph as Media Type and all the fields with a red * are filled up. Then press Move on to next step at the bottom of the webform to load the next step inline. Tip: When entering a location, place or address you will need to click on the Search OpenStreet Maps button, which is what that big red arrow is pointing to in the screenshot above. Note: For now, let's leave the state of this Digital Object as Draft . Why does this look different than Repository X? We assume you come from a world where repositories define different Content types and the shape, the fields and values (Schema) are fixed and set by someone else or at least quite complicated to configure. This is where Archipelago differs and starts to propose its own style. You noticed that there is a single Content Type named Digital Object and you have here a single Web Form. So how does this allow you to have images, sequences, videos, audio, 3D images, etc? There are many ways of answering that, Archipelago works under the idea of an (or many) Open Schema(s), and that notion permeates the whole environment. Practical answer and simplest way to explain based on this demo is: The Digital Object is a generic container for any shape of metadata. Metadata is generated either via this Webform-based widget you're currently using, manually (power-user need only) or via APIs. Because of this, Metadata can take any shape to express your needs of Digital Objects and therefore we do not recommend making multiple Digital Object types. However, if you ever do need more Digital Object types, the option is available. The Strawberry field Field Widget allows you to attach any Webform , built using the Webform Module and Webforms can be setup in almost infinite ways. Any field, combo, or style can be used. Multi Step, single step - we made sure they always only touch/modify data they know how to touch, so even a single input element webform would ensure any previous metadata to persist even if not readable by itself (See the potential?). And Each Webform can be also quite smart! The Strawberry field Field Widget will take all your Webform input, process any uploaded files, generate a JSON representation, enrich and complement it with Archipelago specific data and save it for you inside the Strawberry field . We will come back to this later. Linked Data As the name of this step suggests; you will be adding all your Linked Data elements here. This step showcases some of the autocomplete Linked Data Webform elements we built for Archipelago. We truly believe in Wikidata as an open, honest, source of Linked Open Data and also one where you can contribute back. But we also have LoC autocompletes and Getty. Again, enter all fields with a red * and when you are finished, click Move on to next step Collections Since this is our first digital object we do not yet have a Digital Object Collection for which My First Digital Object could be a member of. In other words, you can leave Collection Membership blank and click Next: Upload Files . Upload Files Now we will upload our Photograph . Click Choose Files to open your file selector window and choose which file you would like to ingest. Once you've uploaded your file, you will see all the Exif data extracted from the image, like so... Once you've mentally digested all of that data, let's go ahead and click Save Metadata . Question: \"Wait! Don't I need to switch Save as from Draft to Publish ? I'm ready for this Digital Object to be shared with the world!\" Answer: By clicking Save Metadata we are simply persisting all the metadata in the current webform session. The actual ingest of the Object happens when you click Save on the next and final step, Complete . Complete Alright, we've made it. We've added metadata, linked Data, uploaded our files and now... we're ready to save ! Go ahead and change the status from Draft to Published and click Save . Once you hit save you should see the following green messages and your first Archipelago Digital Object! Congratulations on creating your first digital object! \ud83c\udf53 Thank you for reading!

To make the process less painful, we recommend you first to read our documentation and deploy a local instance. After that please follow the guidelines below to help you get started. Archipelago welcomes, appreciates, and recognizes any and all types of contribution. This includes input on all use cases and needs, questions or answers, documentation, DevOps, and configurations. We also welcome general ideas, thoughts, and even dreams for the future of our repository! Of course, we also invite you to contribute PHP code, including fixes and new features. We will be helpful, kind, and open. We encourage discussions and always respect one another's opinions, language, gender, style, backgrounds, origins, and destinations, provided they come from the same root values of respect, as stated here. We support conflict resolution using nothing more than basic common sense. We value diversity in all its shapes, forms, colors, epoches, numbers, and kinds, with or without labels, including in-between and evolving. We always assume we can do better and that you have done a lot. Under this very basic social framework, this is how we hope you can contribute: Where The Wild Things Live Archipelago has 5 active GitHub repositories Strawberryfield What? Code: Deals with metadata storage and exposure to Drupal. Events/Subscribers that trigger when content is modified. The way internal pieces of JSON are exposed to the rest of the ecosystem. Core to all of what Archipeleago is as a concept. One of its Drupal forms is a Field. Webform Strawberryfield What? Code: Deals with UI based ingest of content using webforms. How files and media are attached to JSON, how tech md is extracted, and any interaction that happens during the edit and ingest processes via a form. In its Drupal form it provides a Field Widget for Strawberryfield . Format Strawberryfield What? Code: Deals with exposing and transforming the JSON when navigating the site. What is displayed, how it is displayed. Provides templating, metadata display entities via Twig, and direct file downloads. In its Drupal form it provides many field formatters for Strawberryfield` and a content entity for the Twig templates. Archipelago Deployment What? DevOps: Docker-compose deployment strategy, including a full skeleton project with persistence folders for Min.io, DB, Solr, Cantaloupe and Drupal 8. Includes initial deployment configurations, which modules are enabled, how things look in Drupal 8 and some scripts plus the deployment documentation for both OSX and Linux. Archipelago Documentation What? Documentation: This guide and whatever we manage to write to explain Archipelago goes here. Questions, Answers and In Transit Between Both Ends We host a community interaction channel, our google group . This is the best place to ask questions and make suggestions that are not specific to a single module, and/or if you would like to contribute to a larger conversation within our community. Discussions work best in this forum (not excluding GitHub of course), and our official announcements are posted there too. Documentation Workflow Documentation is an evolving effort, and we need help. This guide lives in GitHub in Archipelago Documentation . Documentation and Development Worklfow both work the same way, so keep reading! Development Workflow Start by reading open ISSUES (so you don't end up redoing what someone else is already working on) and looking at our Roadmap for version 1.0.0-RC2 . If the solution to your problem is not there or if there is an unchecked element in the roadmap, this is a great opportunity to help by creating a new ISSUE. Next, start by opening an GitHub ISSUE in any of the 5 GitHub repositories, depending on what it is you are trying to do. Please be concise with the title of your ISSUE so that it is easy to understand. Use Markdown to explain the what, how, etc, of your contribution. Note: Even if something related is already in the works, you can still contribute. Just add your comments on any open ISSUE. Or, if you think you want to contribute with a totally different perspective, feel free to open a new ISSUE anyway. We can always discuss next steps starting from there. Every community has its rhythm and style and our style is just beginning to develop. We are still figuring out what works best for everyone. Once you are done and you feel comfortable working to make a change yourself, take note of the ISSUE number (lets name it #issuenumber ). The gist is: Fork the GitHub repository where you created the ISSUE, decide which branch you want to change. Make a new branch out of that one and name it ISSUE-#issuenumber. E.g if #issuenumber is 6, name your branch ISSUE-6. Make changes in that branch and send a pull request. As a best practice, we encourage pull requests to discuss/fix existing code, new code, and documention changes. For the full step-by-step workflow, we will use Archipelago Documentation and the 1.0.0-RC3 branch as example. The same applies to any of the other repositories: just change the remote urls and use the most current branch name. Example: Set Up Archipelago Documentation GitHub Repository Fork the Archipelago Documentation Upstream source repository to your own personal GitHub account (e.g. YOU). Copy the URL of your Archipelago Documentation fork (you will need it for the git clone command below). $ git clone https://github.com/YOU/archipelago-documentation $ cd archipelago-documentation $ git checkout 1 .0.0-RC3 Set Up Git Remote As upstream $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-documentation $ git fetch upstream $ git merge upstream/1.0.0-RC3 ... Create Your ISSUE Branch Before making changes, make sure you create a branch using the ISSUE number you created for these contributions. $ git checkout -b ISSUE-6 Do Some Clean Up and Test Locally After your code changes, make sure If modifying PHP , run phpcs --standard=Drupal yourchanged.file.php . We (try our best to) use Drupal 8 coding standards. If modifying a MARKDOWN file, make sure it renders well (you can use Textmate, Atom, Textile, etc to preview) and that links are not broken. If writing large pieces of code, add PHP Tests. We can help if you don't know how (tell us in the ISSUE). Tests will be enforced starting with the first stable release. If modifying PHP , please test your changes live on your local instance of Archipelago. All non-documentation modules are already inside web/modules/contrib/ . Commit Changes After verification, commit your changes. This is very good post on how to write commit messages. $ git commit -am 'Fix that Strawberry' Push To The Branch Push your locally committed changes to the remote origin (your fork) $ git push origin ISSUE-6 Create A Pull Request Pull requests can be created via GitHub. This document explains in detail how to create one. After your Pull Request gets peer reviewed and approved, it can be merged.

If the solution to your problem is not there or if there is an unchecked element in the roadmap, this is a great opportunity to help by creating a new ISSUE. Next, start by opening an GitHub ISSUE in any of the 5 GitHub repositories, depending on what it is you are trying to do. Please be concise with the title of your ISSUE so that it is easy to understand. Use Markdown to explain the what, how, etc, of your contribution. Note: Even if something related is already in the works, you can still contribute. Just add your comments on any open ISSUE. Or, if you think you want to contribute with a totally different perspective, feel free to open a new ISSUE anyway. We can always discuss next steps starting from there. Every community has its rhythm and style and our style is just beginning to develop. We are still figuring out what works best for everyone. Once you are done and you feel comfortable working to make a change yourself, take note of the ISSUE number (lets name it #issuenumber ). The gist is: Fork the GitHub repository where you created the ISSUE, decide which branch you want to change. Make a new branch out of that one and name it ISSUE-#issuenumber.

This is the default Webform with Archipelago by following archipelago-deployment . Context When creating an Archipelago Digital Object (ADO), on Step 4 of the ingest, Attach Files , there is a step during the ingest to upload the files associated with your ADO. There will be a section on the Webform outlining the maximum number of files allowed, the maximum file size allowed, and the allowed file extensions that can be uploaded. Let's say we are creating an ADO with the media type DigitalDocument and this ADO contains a data set saved as a csv file, but when we get to Step 4 of the ingest workflow we find that csv is not an allowed file extension. Fortunately, Archipelago has no restrictions on what file extensions can be uploaded, but some use cases will require a little configuring to fit a specific need. This guide will walk users through the steps to modify the default Webform, Descriptive Metadata , to allow additional file extensions to be included during an ingest. Prerequisites for following this guide: Running instance of Archipelago (on http://localhost:8001 if you followed the deployment guide verbatim) Admin credentials Let's begin! Managing Webforms Once logged in as admin , the first thing we need to do is navigate to the Webforms page so we can edit the Webform Descriptive Metadata. Click on Manage , then Structure and when the page loads, scroll down and click Webforms . This is where all of the Webforms inside your Archipelago live. For this guide we're going to edit the Webform Descriptive Metadata . Go ahead and click Build under the OPERATIONS column for Descriptive Metadata . Step 3: Editing Elements Here we see all of the elements in Descriptive Metadata ; Title , Media type , Description , Linked Data elements, etc. The element that we want to edit is Upload Associated Documents as this is the field you will use to upload pdf , doc , rtf , txt , etc. files during the ingest workflow. Click on Edit under the OPERATIONS column. A new screen will pop up named Edit Upload Associated Documents element . This is where you can configure the maximum number of values (under ELEMENT SETTINGS ), the maximum file size and also edit the allowed file extensions for this element, which is what we'll be doing. The latter both exist under FILE SETTINGS section, highlighted in the screenshot below. When you scroll down you'll see the Allowed file extensions field. This is where we will add the csv file extension. Please note: All file extensions are separated by a space; no , or . between the values. Once you've added all the file extensions your project needs, scroll down to the bottom of Edit Upload Associated Documents element and click Save . This next step is imperative for saving your changes , scroll to the bottom of your elements list page and click Save elements in order to persist all changes made. Complete Woohoo! Now when you are ingesting a DigitalDocument object, you will be able to add csv files! \ud83c\udf53 Recap When logged in as an admin, we go to Manage > Structure > Webforms and click on Build under the OPERATIONS column of Descriptive Metadata (shortcut: /admin/structure/webform/manage/descriptive_metadata). Then we click on Upload Associated Documents to edit the element, scroll down to the Allowed file extensions field and add csv without . or , separating the values. Click Save at the bottom of the Edit Upload Associated Documents element page and then Save elements at the bottom of the Webform page. That was helpful, but... How do I upload a wav or aiff file for \"MusicRecording\" or an mov file for a \\\"Movie\\\"? The steps are virtually the same as what is outlined in this guide! The difference here is that instead of editing Upload Associated Documents , you will need to edit the field element that is associated with your ADO's media type. For example, with Media type MusicRecording , you will edit Upload Audio File , for Movie , will edit Videos . How do I know which element in Descriptive Metadata to edit per media type? When editing an element inside Descriptive Metadata , at the top of the window Edit Upload Associated Documents element (see Step 3 for a recap on how to get here) there is a tab next to General titled Conditions . Inside of Conditions we have CONDITIONAL LOGIC which is where the Webform is told which Media type needs this element to be visible in the Webform. In the example below, we know that the field element Upload Associated Documents will be visible when DigitalDocument , Thesis and Book are the selected Media type . This is also the place you can add new logic or delete present logic by clicking the + or - next to the TRIGGER/VALUE to create new conditionals. Thank you for reading!

The latter both exist under FILE SETTINGS section, highlighted in the screenshot below. When you scroll down you'll see the Allowed file extensions field. This is where we will add the csv file extension. Please note: All file extensions are separated by a space; no , or . between the values.

The steps are virtually the same as what is outlined in this guide! The difference here is that instead of editing Upload Associated Documents , you will need to edit the field element that is associated with your ADO's media type. For example, with Media type MusicRecording , you will edit Upload Audio File , for Movie , will edit Videos . How do I know which element in Descriptive Metadata to edit per media type? When editing an element inside Descriptive Metadata , at the top of the window Edit Upload Associated Documents element (see Step 3 for a recap on how to get here) there is a tab next to General titled Conditions . Inside of Conditions we have CONDITIONAL LOGIC which is where the Webform is told which Media type needs this element to be visible in the Webform. In the example below, we know that the field element Upload Associated Documents will be visible when DigitalDocument , Thesis and Book are the selected Media type . This is also the place you can add new logic or delete present logic by clicking the + or - next to the TRIGGER/VALUE to create new conditionals. Thank you for reading!

We made sure that you can copy and paste each of these commands from this guide directly into your terminal. You will notice sometimes commands span more than a single line of text. If that is the case, always make sure you copy and paste a single line at a time and press the Enter key afterwards. We suggest also you look at the output. If something fails (and we hope it does not) troubleshooting will be much easier if you can share that output when asking for help. Happy deploying! Prerequisites (Don't skip) OSX: Install Docker for Mac For OSX Catalina or Big Sur on Intel (i5/i7) the tested version is: 3.3.3(64133) . You may go newer of course. For Big Sur and Apple Silicon M1 Chips please read https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-silicon/. You may need to enable manual compatibility mode in your docker-compose.yml file for the esmero-php and esmero-cantaloupe containers. In Preferences -> General : check Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing and restart. Specially if you are using your $HOME folder for deploying e.g /Users/username In Preferences -> Resources : 4 Gbytes of RAM is the recommended minimun and works, 8 Gbytes is faster and snappier. Install Github Desktop At least 10 Gbytes of free space (to get started) Being able to open a terminal Note: Recent OSX and newer Macs ship with 2 annoying things . Apple Cloud Syncing User Folders and (wait for it), Case insensitive File Systems. If you happy with your shiny new Mac (like i was) we aware that its better to deploy anything mounted outside of the /User folder, or even better, in an external drive formatted using a Case Sensitive Unix Filesystem (Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)). Note 2: \"Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing\" experience may vary, recent Docker for Mac do it well. In older RC1 ones it was evil. Changing/Disabling it after having installed Archipelago may affect your S3/Minio storage accesibility. Please let us know what your experience on this is. Wait! Question: Do you have a previous version of Archipelago running? If so, let's give that hard working repository a break first. If not, skip to Step 1 : Open a terminal (you have that already right?) and go to your previous download/git clone folder and run: docker-compose down docker-compose rm Can't remember where you downloaded it? Ok. We can deal with that! Let's stop the containers gracefully first, run: docker stop esmero-web docker stop esmero-solr docker stop esmero-db docker stop esmero-cantaloupe docker stop esmero-php docker stop esmero-minio Now we need to remove them, run: docker rm esmero-web docker rm esmero-solr docker rm esmero-db docker rm esmero-cantaloupe docker rm esmero-php docker rm esmero-minio Ok, now we are ready to start. Step 1: Docker Deployment git clone https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-deployment.git archipelago-deployment cd archipelago-deployment git checkout 1 .0.0-RC3 cp docker-compose-osx.yml docker-compose.yml docker-compose up -d Note: If you are running from an external Drive or a partition/filesystem that is Case Sensitive and is not syncing automatically to Apple Cloud you can also use docker-compose-linux.yml Note2: docker-compose.yml is git ignored in case you make local adjustments or changes to it. Step 2: Set up your Minio S3 bucket Once all containers are up and running (you can do a docker ps to check), access http://localhost:9000 using your most loved Web Browser with the following credentials: user:minio pass:minio123 and create a bucket named \"archipelago\". To do so press the red/coral + button on the bottom-right side and press the Bucket icon , it has a tooltip that says \"create bucket\". Write archipelago and submit, done! That is where we will persist all your Files and also your File copies of each Digital Object. You can always go there and explore what Archipelago (well really Strawberryfield does the hard work) has persisted so you can get comfortable with our architecture. Step 3: Deploy Drupal 8.9.14 and the awesome Archipelago Modules The following will run composer inside the esmero-php container to download all dependencies and Drupal Core too. docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c \"composer install\" Once that command finishes run our setup script: docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'scripts/archipelago/setup.sh' Explanation: That script will append some important configurations to your local web/sites/default/settings.php . Note: We say local because your whole Drupal web root (the one you cloned) is also mounted inside the esmero-php and esmero-web containers. So edits to, e.g PHP files, can be done without accessing the container directly from your local folder. If this is the first time you Deploy Drupal using the provided Configurations run: docker exec -ti -u www-data esmero-php bash -c \"cd web;../vendor/bin/drush -y si --verbose config_installer config_installer_sync_configure_form.sync_directory=/var/www/html/config/sync/ --db-url=mysql://root:esmerodb@esmero-db/drupal8 --account-name=admin --account-pass=archipelago -r=/var/www/html/web --sites-subdir=default --notify=false install_configure_form.enable_update_status_module=NULL install_configure_form.enable_update_status_emails=NULL;drush cr;chown -R www-data:www-data sites;\" This will give you an admin Drupal user with archipelago as password (!change this if running on a public instance!) Note: About Steps 2-3, you don't need to/nor should do this more than once. You can destroy/stop/update and recreated your Docker containers and start again, git pull and your Drupal and Data will persist once you passed Installation complete message. I repeat, all other container's data is persisted inside the persistent/ folder contained in this cloned git repository. Drupal and all its code is visible, editable and stable inside your web/ folder. Step 4: Create a \"demo \"and a \"jsonapi\" user using drush docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'drush ucrt demo --password=\"demo\"; drush urol metadata_pro \"demo\"' docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'drush ucrt jsonapi --password=\"jsonapi\"; drush urol metadata_api \"jsonapi\"' Step 5: Ingest some Metadata Displays to make playing much more interactive Archipelago is more fun without having to start writing Metadata Displays (in Twig) before you know what they actually are. Since you should now have a jsonapi user and jsonapi should be enabled, you can use that awesome functionality of D8 to get that done. We have 4 demo Metadata Display Entities that go well with the demo Webform we provided. To do that execute in your shell (copy and paste) docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'scripts/archipelago/deploy.sh' Open your most loved Web Browser and point it to http://localhost:8001 Note: It can take some time to start the first time (Drupal needs some warming up). Also, to make this docker-compose easier to use we are doing something named bind mounting (or similar...) your folders. Good thing is you can edit files in your machine and they get updated instantly to docker. bad thing, OSX driver runs slower than on Linux. Speed is a huge factor here, but you get the flexibility of changing, backing up and persisting files without needing a Docker University Degree. Need help? Blue Screen? Missed a step? Need a hug and such? If you see any issues or errors or need help with a step, please let us know (ASAP!). You can either open an issue in this repository or use the Google Group .

You get (yet) again fresh, strange, bizarre, unusual and/or amazing features that were not even asked for! We still work hard to not deviate from our own roadmap, keeping the North Star always visible while navigating these stormy waters, to make UI/UX clearer to understand, code less redundant and easier to follow, to cover (so close) every Media/and LoD base we could wish for. This Archipelago feels like a beach day everyday we use it and manages from time to time produce wonderful surprises. It is our little tiny secret garden/pumpkin/working-bee/undiscovered-magical-islands and we are happy we see it as our own home. A child with grown-up Repository responsabilities, a planned and consistent Architecture Implementation (and still a novell one, cute, cozy and simple) that can cover, mix and match GLAM, IR, Data and Scientific/Research/Museum Tech/Education needs, metadata and media in any shape. Ambitions never end to be enorm (we try to be humble) and we are always a bit quite tired (same as with Beta1, Beta2, Beta3 and RC1). Who knew we could write so much code and deploy and test over and over? We know the Horizon is still far away and we may never end sailing towards it. No need to tell you that 2020 and 2021 so far have been strange years and there is and will be constant reflecting on past times. Many many more Archipelagos have been emerging from the depths of the sea (and the shallow Internet) and a few already are blooming rich in local flora and fauna. We want to keep learning and sharing and you to keep asking, we may make mistakes while doing so, but our conviction that all still fits together and makes sense not only for us but most important for others is very strong. Since the beginning (a red evening under the big sky of Montana) our initial architecture and divergent ideas of what Metadata managment, workflows and media preservation should be, have been controversial and sometimes hard to explian. But, archipelago's simplicity, flexibility, ease of extension, its chameleon-ish capability to assume new shapes, colors and aromas, use cases without coding has shown us we put our efforts in the right dream and the right people. Fun to use, fun to code on and solid to build on. If you like it or not, want new features or want to part of making this better, documenting, coding and planning, let us know.

It is our little tiny secret garden/pumpkin/working-bee/undiscovered-magical-islands and we are happy we see it as our own home. A child with grown-up Repository responsabilities, a planned and consistent Architecture Implementation (and still a novell one, cute, cozy and simple) that can cover, mix and match GLAM, IR, Data and Scientific/Research/Museum Tech/Education needs, metadata and media in any shape. Ambitions never end to be enorm (we try to be humble) and we are always a bit quite tired (same as with Beta1, Beta2, Beta3 and RC1). Who knew we could write so much code and deploy and test over and over? We know the Horizon is still far away and we may never end sailing towards it. No need to tell you that 2020 and 2021 so far have been strange years and there is and will be constant reflecting on past times. Many many more Archipelagos have been emerging from the depths of the sea (and the shallow Internet) and a few already are blooming rich in local flora and fauna. We want to keep learning and sharing and you to keep asking, we may make mistakes while doing so, but our conviction that all still fits together and makes sense not only for us but most important for others is very strong. Since the beginning (a red evening under the big sky of Montana) our initial architecture and divergent ideas of what Metadata managment, workflows and media preservation should be, have been controversial and sometimes hard to explian. But, archipelago's simplicity, flexibility, ease of extension, its chameleon-ish capability to assume new shapes, colors and aromas, use cases without coding has shown us we put our efforts in the right dream and the right people. Fun to use, fun to code on and solid to build on. If you like it or not, want new features or want to part of making this better, documenting, coding and planning, let us know. Talk (or whisper) to us.","title":"1.0.0-RC3"},{"location":"quickstart/#caring-coding-fixing-testing","text":"Diego Pino Giancarlo Birello Allison Lund Albert Min","title":"Caring &amp; Coding + Fixing + Testing"},{"location":"quickstart/#acknowledgments","text":"This software is a Metropolitan New York Library Council Open-Source initiative and part of the Archipelago Commons project.","title":"Acknowledgments"},{"location":"quickstart/#license","text":"GPLv3","title":"License"},{"location":"sslsetup/","text":"How to Setup SSL for Docker/Archipelago Work-In-Progress Note This documentation page is still under construction and content may change with future updates.

Manual Configuration Steps for an EC2 AWS Server This process takes less than 10 minutes of reading YML files and editing a few files (described below) to get SSL running and setup with auto-renewal. First, configure Certbot, following the instructions found on https://certbot.eff.org. Inside a /persistent partition, establish the following folder structure. Note: you can keep the existing folder structure if you so choose. A benefit of the following structure is that it decouples the git clone of archipelago-deployment, which is made to be self sustainable and good for coding or smaller deployments.

At a glance When taking a look at your First Digital Object note that multiple formatters are working together to create this Display ( or View mode ). Since \" My First Digital Object \" is a Photograph the Display being used is Digital Object Full View which, by default, uses formatters to: ( Red ) Create the image viewer where users can zoom in, zoom out, fullscreen and rotate all the images associated with the ADO. ( Blue ) Display the Object Description and Type of Resource . ( Green ) Display the Raw JSON Metadata and IIIF Presentation Manifest. In Greater Detail When editing an ADO, at the top of the Webform page there is a tab titled Manage display which will take us to where all the Formatters live. Take note that the DISPLAY SETTINGS shown in the screenshot below are using the Default View mode. Once the page loads the Default View mode is automatically selected. However, because we are editing an object with the Media type Photograph , we need to edit the View mode Digital Object Full View since it is the Default View mode for this Media type . How to find and configure which View mode is Default per Media type The ADO Type to View mode Mapping page tells the ADOs which View mode to use by default per Media type.

PanoramaTour Digital Object with Pannellum Panorama There are two sections in Manage display for Digital Object Full View : 1) Content and 2) Disabled . Moving a field into Content means this formatter will be used to the display the ADO in some way. The formatters moved to Disabled are inactive and are subsequently not being used for displaying the ADO. There are four fields named \ud83c\udf53Strawberry and each one is a copy of the field \ud83c\udf53Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) . Since the names of the fields do not imply their function, they have been named Strawberry in four different ways (Italiano, Deutsch, Din\u00e9 Bizaad, and English) in order to organize and help users visually remember which field is doing what for the Display . Recall My First Digital Object at beginning of this document where there were 3 sections highlighted in Red , Blue , and Green . In Red ( \ud83c\udf53Fragola ) there is the Strawberry Field Formatter for IIIF media which takes the image stored in S3 to display the photograph with the image viewer. In Blue ( \ud83c\udf53Erdbeere ) there is the Strawberry Field Formatter for Custom Metadata Templates which displays the raw JSON metadata using configurable Twig templates. In this example, the default Twig template uses the JSON key type to display the Type of Resource . In Green ( \ud83c\udf53Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata) ) there is the Strawberry Default Formatter which is used to display the Raw JSON Metadata. At the end of the day The decision for how your metadata is displayed is totally in your control. Under the WIDGET column, there is a quick description/overview of what the formatter is doing. And by clicking on the gear icon under the OPERATIONS column, all of the options for configuring the formatter are revealed. To use \ud83c\udf53Fragola as an example (the Formatter for IIIF media), we can choose which JSON Key is being used to fetch the IIIF Media URLs (found inside the raw JSON being played with Strawberry Default Formatter ), the maximum height and width of the viewer, etc. And then with \ud83c\udf53Erdbeere (the Formatter for Custom Metadata Templates) there is the option, among many others, to configure which Twig template the formatter will use for displaying your Metadata. More information about Managing Metadata Displays with Twig Templates can be found here . Thank you for reading!

Moving a field into Content means this formatter will be used to the display the ADO in some way. The formatters moved to Disabled are inactive and are subsequently not being used for displaying the ADO. There are four fields named \ud83c\udf53Strawberry and each one is a copy of the field \ud83c\udf53Strawberry (Descriptive Metadata source) . Since the names of the fields do not imply their function, they have been named Strawberry in four different ways (Italiano, Deutsch, Din\u00e9 Bizaad, and English) in order to organize and help users visually remember which field is doing what for the Display . Recall My First Digital Object at beginning of this document where there were 3 sections highlighted in Red , Blue , and Green . In Red ( \ud83c\udf53Fragola ) there is the Strawberry Field Formatter for IIIF media which takes the image stored in S3 to display the photograph with the image viewer. In Blue ( \ud83c\udf53Erdbeere ) there is the Strawberry Field Formatter for Custom Metadata Templates which displays the raw JSON metadata using configurable Twig templates. In this example, the default Twig template uses the JSON key type to display the Type of Resource .

By design (and because we think its imperative), Archipelago takes full charge of the metadata layer and associated media assets by implementing a highly configurable, smart Drupal field written in JSON named Strawberryfield that attaches to any content. All of JSON's internals, keys, paths, and values are dynamically exposed to the rest of the ecosystem. Strawberryfield even remembers its structure as data evolves by storing JSON paths of every little detail. Nothing Is Real Archipelago includes additional companion modules, Webform_strawberryfield and Format_strawberryfield that extend the core metadata capabilities of the main Strawberryfield module and allow the same flexibility to be exposed during ingest and viewing of digital objects. The in-development Strawberry Runners and AMI modules further extend Archipelago's capabilities. Additional information related to these modules will be made available following initial public releases. Ingesting Webform Strawberryfield (we had a better name) extends and integrates into the amazing Drupal Webform module to allow Archipelago users to build any possible metadata and media, ingest and edit, workflows directly via the UI using webforms. By not having a hardcoded ingest method, Archipelago can be used outside the GLAM community too, as a pure data repository in biological sciences, digital humanities, archives, or even as a mixed, multidisciplinary/cross-domain system. We also added WIKIDATA , LoC , Getty , and VIAF authority querying elements to aid in linking to external Linked Open Data sources. All these integrations are made to help local needs and community identities to survive the never-ending race for the next metadata schema. They are made to prototype, plan, and grow independently of how metadata will need to be exposed yesterday or tomorrow. And we plan to add more. Explore what other features webform_strawberryfield provides to help with ingesting, reading, and interacting with your metadata during that process. Exposing Format Strawberryfield (we had even a better name but...) deals with taking your JSON based metadata and casting , mashing, mixing, exposing, displaying, and transforming it to allow rich interaction for users and other systems with your digital objects. In its guts (or heart?), Archipelago does something quite simple but core to our concept of repository: it transforms in realtime the close to your needs open schema metadata that lives in strawberryfield as JSON into close to other one's fixed schema needs metadata ; any destination format, using a fast, cached templating system. A templating system that is core to Drupal, called Twig : Twig in Symfony Twig in Drupal This templating system is exposed to Archipelago users through the UI and stored side by side in the repository as content (we named them Metadata Display entities , but they not only serve display needs!) so users can fully control how metadata is transformed and published without touching their individual sources. Templates or recipes can be shared, exported, ingested, updated, and adapted in many ways. Fast changes are possible without having to wait for the next mayor release of Archipelago or your favorited Metadata Schema Specs Committee agreeing on the next or the last version. Of course, this module not only handles metadata but media assets too, extracting local or remote URIs and files from your metadata and rendering them as media viewers: books, 3D models, images, panoramas, A/V with IIIF in its soul.

We made sure that you can copy and paste each of these commands from this guide directly into your terminal. You will notice sometimes commands span more than a single line of text. If that is the case, always make sure you copy and paste a single line at a time and press the Enter key afterwards. We suggest also you look at the output. If something fails (and we hope it does not) troubleshooting will be much easier if you can share that output when asking for help. Happy deploying! Prerequisites At least 10 Gbytes of free space (to get started) Some basic Unix/Terminal Skills 2-4 Gbytes of RAM (4 Recommended) Install Docker if you don't have it already by running: sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable\" sudo apt update sudo apt-cache policy docker-ce sudo apt install docker-ce sudo systemctl status docker sudo usermod -aG docker ${ USER } Log out, log in again! sudo apt install docker-compose Git tools are included by default in Ubuntu Wait! Question: Do you have a previous version of Archipelago running? If so, let's give that hard working repository a break first. If not, Step 1 : Open a terminal (you have that already right?) and go to your previous download/git clone folder and run: docker-compose down docker-compose rm Can't remember where you downloaded it? Ok. We can deal with that! Let's stop the containers gracefully first, run: docker stop esmero-web docker stop esmero-solr docker stop esmero-db docker stop esmero-cantaloupe docker stop esmero-php docker stop esmero-minio Now we need to remove them, run: docker rm esmero-web docker rm esmero-solr docker rm esmero-db docker rm esmero-cantaloupe docker rm esmero-php docker rm esmero-minio Ok, now we are ready to start. Step 1: Deployment Prefer to watch a video of how to install? Go to our user contributed documentation ! IMPORTANT If you run docker-compose as root user (using sudo ) some enviromental variables, like the current folder used inside the docker-compose.yml to mount the Volumens will not work and you will see a bunch of errors. There are two possible solutions. The best is to add your user to the docker group (so no sudo needed). Second option is to replace every {$PWD} inside your docker-compose.yml with either the full path to your current folder, or with a . and wrap that whole line in double quotes, basically making the paths for volumens relatives. Instead of: - ${PWD}:/var/www/html:cached use: - \".:/var/www/html:cached\" Now that you got it, lets deploy: git clone https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-deployment.git archipelago-deployment cd archipelago-deployment git checkout 1 .0.0-RC3 And now a hard choice. Which docker-compose/ensemble? Edge? Stable? Legacy? So many choices. For latest/modern stack PHP7.4/Solr8.8/MySQL8 we recommend: cp docker-compose-linux.yml docker-compose.yml docker-compose up -d You have something running and do not want to update Databases/Solr indexes: Go legact. In doubt? Ask us please. We can help. If you want to stay more traditional and stick with older versions PHP7.3/Solr7.5/MySQL57 we recommend cp docker-compose-legacy.yml docker-compose.yml docker-compose up -d Note: docker-compose.yml is git ignored in case you make local adjustments or changes to it. You need to make sure Docker can read/write to your local Drive a.k.a mounted volumens (specially if you decided not to run it as root , because we told you so!) This means in practice running: sudo chown -R 100 :100 persistent/iiifcache sudo chown -R 8983 :8983 persistent/solrcore And then docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c \"chown -R www-data:www-data private\" Question: why this last command different: Answer: Just a variation. Long answer is the internal www-data user in that container (Alpine Linux) has uid:82, but on ubuntu the www-data user has a different one so we let docker assing the uid from inside instead. In practice you could also run directly sudo chown -R 82:82 private which would only apply to an Alpine use case, which can differ in the future! Does this make sense? No worries if not. Step 2: Set up your Minio S3 bucket Once all containers are up and running (you can do a docker ps to check), access http://localhost:9000 using your most loved Web Browser with the following credentials: user:minio pass:minio123 and create a bucket named \"archipelago\". To do so press the red/coral + button on the bottom-right side and press the Bucket icon , it has a tooltip that says \"create bucket\". Write archipelago and submit, done! That is where we will persist all your Files and also your File copies of each Digital Object. You can always go there and explore what Archipelago (well really Strawberryfield does the hard work) has persisted so you can get comfortable with our architecture. Step 3: Deploy Drupal 8.9.14 and the awesome Archipelago Modules The following will run composer inside the esmero-php container to download all dependencies and Drupal Core too. docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c \"composer install\" You will see a warning: Do not run Composer as root/super user! See https://getcomposer.org/root for details and the a long list of PHP packages, don't worry, all is good here, keep following the instructions! Once that command finishes run our setup script: docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'scripts/archipelago/setup.sh' Explanation: That script will append some important configurations to your local web/sites/default/settings.php . Note: We say local because your whole Drupal web root (the one you cloned) is also mounted inside the esmero-php and esmero-web containers. So edits to, e.g PHP files, can be done without accessing the container directly from your local folder. If this is the first time you Deploy Drupal using the provided Configurations run: docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c \"cd web;../vendor/bin/drush -y si --verbose config_installer config_installer_sync_configure_form.sync_directory=/var/www/html/config/sync/ --db-url=mysql://root:esmerodb@esmero-db/drupal8 --account-name=admin --account-pass=archipelago -r=/var/www/html/web --sites-subdir=default --notify=false install_configure_form.enable_update_status_module=NULL install_configure_form.enable_update_status_emails=NULL;drush cr;chown -R www-data:www-data sites;\" This will give you an admin Drupal user with archipelago as password (!change this if running on a public instance!) and also set the right Docker Container owner for your Drupal installation files. Note: About Steps 2-3, you don't need to/nor should do this more than once. You can destroy/stop/update and recreated your Docker containers and start again, git pull and your Drupal and Data will persist once you passed Installation complete message. I repeat, all other container's data is persistet inside the persistent/ folder contained in this cloned git repository. Drupal and all its code is visible, editable and stable inside your web/ folder. Step 4: Create a \"demo \"and a \"jsonapi\" user using drush docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'drush ucrt demo --password=\"demo\"; drush urol metadata_pro \"demo\"' docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'drush ucrt jsonapi --password=\"jsonapi\"; drush urol metadata_api \"jsonapi\"' Step 5: Ingest some Metadata Displays to make playing much more interactive Archipelago is more fun without having to start writing Metadata Displays (in Twig) before you know what they actually are. Since you should now have a jsonapi user and jsonapi should be enabled, you can use that awesome functionality of D8 to get that done. We have 4 demo Metadata Display Entities that go well with the demo Webform we provided. To do that execute in your shell (copy and paste) docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'scripts/archipelago/deploy.sh' You are done! Open your most loved Web Browser and point it to http://localhost:8001 Note: It can take some time to start the first time (Drupal needs some warming up). The Ubuntu deployment is WAY faster than the OSX deployment because of the way the bind mount volumens are handled by the driver. Our experience is that Archipelago basically reacts instantly!

That functionality lives under the \"Display Modes\" and can be accessed at yoursite/admin/structure/display-modes . In a few quick words, The Display Mode Concept covers: formatting your Content Entities and their associated Fields so when a user lands on a Content Page, they are displayed in a certain, hopefully pleasing, way and also how users with proper Credentials can fill inputs/edit values for each field a Content Entity provides. First, formatting output (basically building the front facing page for each content entity) is done by a View Mode . Second, defining how/what input method you are going to use to create or edit Content entities, is handled by a Form Mode . Both Modes, are, in Drupal Lingo, Configuration Entities, they provide things you can configure, you can name them and reuse them and those configurations can all be exported and reimported using YAML files. Also both Modes the following in common: Drupal always provides a \"default\" one that can not be deleted. You can create new ones. You can apply permissions to them. All Modes work on \"fields\", means the tiny little input/output pieces that are either part of a Content Entity or attached to them (the title, the Body, and in our case a Strawberryfield (SBF), They Provide Config/setting options for each Field. They are always associated to Content Types/Bundles. Means all Nodes of the same Content type will share the same modes. The main difference, other than their purpose (Output v/s Input) is that, on View Modes, the settings you apply to each field are associated to \"Formatters\" and on Form Modes, the settings you apply to each field are connected to \"Widgets\". So, resuming, this is what lives under the Concept of a \"Display Mode\": View Mode Each field attached to a Content Entity can have a Formatter applied and most of them have configuration options. Formatters do one thing right: they take the raw, stored value and make it \"visible\" inside Drupal. Which formatters are available will depend on the \"type\" of field the Content Entity has. E.g A Node title/Label will have a Title formatter with the option of just displaying a text or a text with a link to the entity. More Complex and fun Fields, like the ones of type SBF will provide a large list of possible Formatters , like IIIF driven viewers, Video formatters, Metadata Display (Twig template driven) ones, etc. This is because a SBF type of field has much more than just a text value, it contains a full graph of metadata and properties, inclusive links to Files and provenance metadata. Form Mode Each field attached to a Content Entity can have a Widget applied and most of them have configuration options. Widgets do one thing right: they expose some type of Form/UI interaction that allows a user to input data into the Entity, under that specific field. And of course they make sure that what you input is validated and saved (if good) correctly. Which Widgets are available will depend on the \"type\" of field the Content Entity has. Example: A Node Title will have a single Text Input with some options, like the size of the Textfield used to feed it. More Complex and fun fields, like the ones of type SBF (strawberryfield), will provide a larger list of possible Widgets, ranging from raw JSON input (which you could select if your data was already in the right format) to the reason we are reading this: Webform driven Widgets . These Widgets include: ones the webform_strawberryfield Drupal module provides ones that use an existing Webform (which are also Entitites!) which either 1) you created or 2) we provided as a setting If you chose a widget other than the raw JSON, the widget will take the raw JSON to build, massage and enrich the data so that it can be presented in a visual format by the SBF. This is because a SBF type of field has much more than just a text value. It contains a full graph of metadata and properties, inclusive links to Files and provenance metadata, which for example allows us to use an Upload field directly in the attached/configured webform. - Form modes also have an additional benefit. Each one can have fine grained permissions. That way you can have many different Form Modes, but allow only certain ones to be visible, or usable by users of a given Drupal Role. I think i get this...but how can i use this knowledge now? Good question! So, to enable, configure, and customize these Display Modes you have to navigate to your Content Type Configuration page in your running Archipelago. This is found at /admin/structure/types . Note: the way things are named in Drupal can be confusing to even the most deeply committed Drupal user, so bear in mind some terms will change. Feel free to read and re-read. You can see that for every existent Content Type, there is a drop down menu with options: Manage Display: will lead you to configuration page where you can setup each View Mode and its settings for a given Content Type Manage Form Display: will lead you to configuration page where you can setup each View Mode and its settings for a given Content Type Manage Display On the top you will see all your View Modes Listed, with the Default one selected and expanded. The Table that follows has one row per Field attached/part of this Content Type. Some of the fields are part of the Content Type itself, in this case Digital Object (bundled) and some other ones are common to every Content Entity derived from a Node. The \"Field\" column contains each field name (not their type, reason why you don't see Strawberry Field there!) but we can tell you right now that there is one, named \"Descriptive Metadata\", that is of SBF type. Wait! Which are the fields in my Content Type? How do we know that the field named \"Descriptive Metadata\" is a Strawberryfield? Well, we set-up the Digital Object Content Type for you that way, but also you can know what we know by pressing on \"Manage fields\" Tab on the top (don't forget to come back to \"Manage display\", afterwards!) Also Surprise: You Content Entity has really really just 2 fields! And that, friends, is one of the secret ingredients of Archipelago. All goes into a Single Field. But wait: i see more fields in my Manage Display table. Why? Well. Some of them are base fields, part of what a Drupal Node is: base field means you can not remove them, they are part of the Definition itself. One obvious one is the Title . But there are also some fields very particular to Archipelago: You can see there are also ones named \"Formatter Object Metadata\", \"Media\" and one named \"Static Media\"!. Where does come from? Those are also Strawberryfields. It sounds confusing but it is really simple. They are really not \"fields\" in the sense of having different data than \"Descriptive Metadata\". Those are In Memory, realtime, copies of the \"Descriptive Metadata\" SBF field and are there to overcome one limitation of Drupal 8: Each Field can have a single \"Formatter\" setup per field. But we want to re-usue the JSON data to show a Viewer, Show Metadata as HTML directly on the ADO/NODE landing page, and we want also to, for example, format sometimes images as Thumbnails and not using a IIIF viewer only. This CopyFields (Legal term) have also a nice Performance advantage. Drupal needs to fetch only once the data from the real Field, \"Descriptive Metadata\", from the database. And then just makes the data available in real time to its copies. That makes all fast, very very fast! And of course flexible. As you dig more into Archipelago you will see the benefits of this approach. Finally, if you need to, you can make more CopyFields. But the reality is, there is a single, only one, SBF in each Digital Object and its named \"Descriptive Metadata\". You can also simply not care about the type and trust the UI. It will just show Formatters that are right for each type and expose Configuration options (and a little abstract of the current ones) under the Widget Column. Operations Columns allows you to setup each Widget. Widget term here is a bit confusing. These are not really Widget in terms of Data Input, but in terms of \"Configuration\" Input. But D8/9 is evolving and its getting better. Those settings apply always only to the current View Mode. You can play with this, experiment and change some settings to get more comfortable. We humbly propose you that you complete this info with the official Drupal 8 Documentation and also apply custom settings to your own, custom View Mode so you don't end changing base, expected functionality while you are still learning. Manage Form Display On the top you will see all your Form Modes Listed, with the Default one selected and expanded. The Table that follows has one row per Field attached/partof this Content Type. The list of fields here is shorter, the SBF CopyFields are not present because all data goes really only into real fields. Also some other, display only ones (means you can not modify them) will not appear here. Again, Some of the fields are part of the Content Type itself, in this case Digital Object (bundled) and some other ones are common to every Content Entity derived from a Node. \"Field\" column contains each field name and the Widget Column allows you to select what type of Input you are going to use to feed it on Ingest/edit. On the right you will see again a little gear, that allows you to configure the settings for a particular Widget. Those settings apply always only to the current Form Mode. So. The one we want to understand is the one attached to the \"Descriptive Metadata\" field. Currently one named \"Strawberryfield webform based input with inline rendering\". There are other two. But let's start with this. Press on the Gear to the right on the same row. AS you can see there are not too many options. But, the main, first Text input is an Autocomplete field that will resolve against your existing Webforms. So, guess what. If you want to use your own Webform to feed a SBF, what do you do? You type the name, let the autocomplete work, select the right Webform, maybe your own custom one, and the you press \"Update\". Once that is done you need to \"Save\" your Form Mode (hint, button at the bottom of the page). We wish life was that easy (and it will once we are done with refining Drupal's UI) but for now there are some extra things you need to do to make sure the Webform, your custom one, can speak JSON. The default one you get named also \"Descriptive Metadata (descriptive_metadata)\", same as the field, is already setup to be used. Means if you create a new Webform by Copying that one, you can start using it inmediately. But if you created one from scratch (Different tutorial) you need to setup some settings. Setting up a Webform to talk Strawberryfield Navigate to your Webform Managment form at /admin/structure/webform If you already created a Webform (different tutorial on how to do that) you will see your own named one in that list. I created for the purpose of this documentation one named \"Diego Test\" (Hi, i'm Diego..) and on the most right Column, \"Operations\" you will haven an Drop Down Menu. On your own Webform row, press on \"Settings\". First time, this can be a little bit intimitading. We recommend going baby steps since the Webform Module is a very powerful one but also exposes you to a lot (and sometimes too many) options. Even more, if you are new to Webforms, we recomment you to copy the \"Descriptive Metadata\" Webform we provided first, and make small changes to it (starting by naming it your own way!) so you can see how that affects your workflow and experience, and how that interacts with the created metadata. The Webform Module provides testing and building capabilities, so you have a Playground there before actually ingesting ADOs. Copying it will also make all the needed settings for SBF interaction to be moved over, so your work will be much easier. But we know you did not do that (where is the fun there right?). So lets setup one from scratch. General Settings Gist here is (look at the screenshot and copy the settings): GENERAL Settings: Check \"Disable saving of submissions\" option. You won't need this form to generate a Native Webform Submission entry. AJAX Settings: Check \"use ajax\" option. We want people to have the experience of staying in a single page while the create a new ADO via a Multi Step Webform Workflow. Confirmation Settings Gist here is (again, look at the screenshot and copy the settings): Select \"Inline Confirmation\". You don't want Webform to send your user to another page while they are still ingesting their ADOs. Handler The glue, the piece of resistance. The handler is the one that knows how to talk to a SBF. In simple words, the handler (any handler) provides functionality that does something with a Webform Submission. The one that you want to select here, is the \"Strawberryfield harvester\" handler. Add it, name it whatever you like (or copy what you see in the screenshot) and make sure you select, if running using our deployment strategy, \"S3 File System\" as the option for \"Permanent Destination for uploaded files\". The wording is tricky there, its not really Permanent, since that is handled by Archipelago, but more to Temporary, while working in ingesting an Object, destination for the Webform. Its not really wrong neither. Its permanent for the Webform, but we have better plans for the files and metadata! Save your settings. And you are ready to roll. That webform can now be used as a Setting for any of the StrawberryField Widgets that use Webforms. Finally (the real finally). Archipelago encourages at least one Field/JSON key to be present always. One with \"type\" as key value. So make sure that your Custom Webform has that one. There are two ways of doing that: You can copy how it is setup from the provided Webform's Elements, from the main Descriptive Metadata Webform and then add one \"select\" element to yours using the same \"type\" \"key\".Important in Archipelago is always the key value since that is what builds the JSON for your metadata. The Description can be any, but for UI consistency you could want to keep it the same across all your webforms. Or, advanced, you can use the import/export capabilities (Webforms are just YAML files!) and export/copy your custom one as text, add the following element before or after some existing elements there type : '#type' : select '#title' : 'Media Type' '#options' : schema_org_creative_works '#required' : true '#label_attributes' : class : - custom-form-input-heading And then reimport. Having a \"type\" value will make your life easier. You don't need it, but everything works smoother that way. Since you have a single Content Type named Digital Object, having a Webform field that has as key \"type\", which leads to a \"type\" JSON key, allows you to discern the Nature of your Digital Object, book or Podcast, Image or 3D and do smart, nice things with them.

Single JSON Value. For \"type\": \"Photograph\" \"type\" = JSON Key or Property \"Photograph\" = Single JSON Value (string) Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of Strings ) - For \"language\": [\"English\",\"Spanish\"] - \"language\" = JSON Key or Property - \"[\"English\",\"Spanish\"]\" = Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of Strings ) Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of Objects ) For \"subject_loc\":[{\"uri\":\"http://..\",\"label\":\"Dogs\"},{\"uri\":\"http://..\",\"label\":\"Pets\"}] \"subject_loc\" = JSON Key or Property [{\"uri\":\"http://..\",\"label\":\"Dogs\"},{\"uri\":\"http://..\",\"label\":\"Pets\"}] = Object with two JSON Keys. Each one with a single Value Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of Objects ) Getting Started with the Twig Language in Archipelago Data is known as Context in Twig Lingo. All your JSON Strawberryfield Metadata is accessible inside a Variable named data in your twig template. You can access the values by using data DOT Property (attribute) Name . In the Laddie the Dog example shown above (originally) : data.type will contain \"Photograph\" data.language will contain [ \"English\" ] data.language[0] will contain \"English\" 0 means first entry in an Array or Enumeration data.subject_loc will contain [{ \"uri\":\"http://..\",\"label\": \"Dog\" }] data.subject_loc.uri will contain \"http://..\" data.subject_loc.label will contain \"Dog\" Please note: you also have access to other info in your context node : such as node.id is the Drupal ID of your Current ADO; Also is_front , language , is_admin , logged_in and more! Twig Statements and Printing https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html Simple examples using Printing Statements Single JSON Value Example: Twig template: Hello I am a {{ data.type }} and very happy to meet you Rendered output: Hello I am a Photograph and very happy to meet you Multiple JSON Values Example: Twig template: Hello I was classified as \" {{ data.subject_loc [ 0 ] .label }} \" and very happy to meet you Rendered Output: Hello I was classified as \"Dogs\" and very happy to meet you Twig Statements and Executing https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/if.html Rendered Output based upon different Twig conditionals , operators , tests , assignments , and filters Example 1: Twig template: {% if data.subject_loc is defined %} Hey I have a Subject Key {% else %} Ups no Subject Key {% endif %} Rendered Output: Hey I have a Subject Key Conditionals, Operator, and Test usage: If/else are conditionals is is an operator defined is a test Example 2: Twig template: {% for key , subject in data.subject_loc %} * Subject {{ subject.label }} found at position {{ key }} {% endfor %} Rendered Output: * Subject Dogs found at position 0 Loop usage: for is a loop Inside the loop you have access to key , subject Example 3: Twig template: {% for subject in data.subject_loc %} {% set label_lowercase = subject.label | lower %} My lower case Subject is {{ label_lowercase }} {% endfor %} Rendered Output: My lower case Subject is dogs Assignment, Filter, and Loop uage: set is an assignment | is a pipe, used after a value to apply a filter . lower is a filter Inside the loop you have have access to subject and label_lowercase Example 4: Twig template: {% for subject in data.subject_loc %} {% set label_lowercase = subject.label | lower %} My lower case Subject is {{ label_lowercase }} {% endfor %} {# This won\u2019t display because it was assigned inside The For Loop #} {{ label_lowercase }} Rendered Output: My lower case Subject is dogs Full Examples for Common Uses Cases: Use case #1: I have multiple LoD Subjects and want to display them in my page as a clickable ordered list but I\u2019m a safe/careful person. Twig Example for Use Case #1: {% if data.subject_loc is iterable and data.subject_loc is not empty %} <h2>My Subjects</h2> <ul> {% for subject in data.subject_loc %} <li> <a href=\" {{ subject.uri }} \" title=\" {{ subject.label | capitalize }} \" target=\"_blank\"> {{ subject.label }} </a> </li> {% endfor %} </ul> {% endif %} Use case #2: I have sometimes a publication date.

Get yourself an example document (Frame) . If HTML copy the source. If XML copy the full XML. (cmd+c) Create a new Metadata Display Entity . Copy the content (text) of your Frame into the Edit window. (cmd+v) Select an existing (as complete as possible) ADO to use as preview, press Preview. Put your nice glasses on. What do you see? What data in your Frame do you have in your ADO (data)? Start nimble. Selected the data.label info, check where your Frame uses a Title or a Label . Remove that text (cmd+x) and replace with a {{ data.label }} . Press Preview. Do you see your title? Keep doing 6 , over and over. Leave complex values for the end. (e.g data.subject_loc ) Document your changes. {# I added this because .. #} Save.

It involves interacting with the esmero/archipelago-docker-images repo and the esmero/archipelago-deployment repo. Part 1: Docker Run the following commands from your /archipelago-deployment directory: docker-compose down \\ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d This version of docker-compose up uses an override file to modify our services. docker-compose.dev.yml we now have an extra PHP container called esmero-php-debug . To stop the containers in the future, run docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml down . (To make these commands easier to remember, consider making bash aliases in your .bashrc file.) (If you are running your development on a Linux system, you may need to make a modification to your xdebug configuration file on the esmero-php-dev container. See appendix at the bottom of this page.) So we have reloaded the containers and now you are ready for Part 2. Part 2: PHPStorm In PHPStorm, open your archipelago-deployment project. Go to Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Debug or Settings > PHP > Servers . In this window there is an Xdebug section. Use these settings: Debug port: 9003 . (do NOT use the default, 9000) Can accept external connections: yes, select checkbox (optional) Break at first line in PHP scripts: uncheck. If you leave this selected, you will have to manually step through a breakpoint from Drupal's main index.php file on every request, which is quite annoying. However, leaving this box checked can be useful for making sure the connection is working at first, before you have set any internal breakpoints. Your settings should look like this. Hit APPLY and OK. Go to Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Servers . We will create a new server here. Use these settings: Name: docker-debug-server Host: localhost Port: 8001 Use path mappings: yes, select the checkbox Under project files, select the top-level archipelago-deployment directory in the File/Directory column. In the Absolute path on the server add /var/www/html Hit APPLY and OK and close the window. Go to Run > Edit Configurations . Hit the + Button to create a new PHP Remote Debug. Name whatever you want, I called mine Archipelago . Use these settings: Filter debug connection by IDE Key: yes, select the checkbox Server: select docker-debug-server from dropdown (we created this in step 3) IDE Key: archipelago (this matches the key set in our container) Note: If you try to validate your connection, it will fail. But that's ok. Validate your connection. With Run > Edit Configurations still open, you can hit the link that says \"Validate\". Use these settings in the following validation window: Path to create validation script <your local path>/archipelago-deployment/web Url to validation script: http://localhost:8001 Hit VALIDATE. You should get a series of green check marks. If you get a warning about missing php.ini file, that is OK, our file has a different name in the container ( xdebug.ini ) and is still being read correctly. Set up Browser Integration We have had success using the XDebug Helper extension in Chrome. Once you have the extension installed, right-click on the bug icon in the top right of your chrome browser window and select \"Options\" to configure the IDE key. Under \"IDE\", select \"Other\", and in the text box, enter \"archipelago\" Actually Debugging! Hit the button (top right bar of PHPStorm) that looks like a telephone, for Start Listening for PHP Debug Connections . Now, you can use Run > Debug and select the Archipelago named configuration that we created in the previous steps. The debugging console will appear. It will say it is waiting for incoming connection from 'archipelago' . Right now the debugging session is not enabled. Browse to localhost:8001 . Click on the gray XDebug Helper icon at the top right of your window and select the green \"Debug\" button. This will tell chrome to set the xdebug session key when you reload the page. Now set a breakpoint in your code, and refresh the page. If you have breakpoints set, either manually, or from leaving \"Break at first line in PHP scripts\" checked, you should have output now in the debugger. If you are done actively debugging, it is best to click the green XDebug Helper icon and select \"Disable\". This will greatly improve speed and performance for your app in development. When you need to debug, just turn on debugging using the XDebug Helper button again. If you would like to see the output of your xdebug logs, run the following script: docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'tail -f /tmp/xdebug.log > /proc/1/fd/2' Then, you can use the typical docker logs command on the esmero-php container, and you will see the xdebug output: docker logs esmero-php -f Xdebug makes accessing variables in Drupal kind of great. Many possibilities, including debugging for Twig templates. Happy debugging! Appendix: XDebug on a linux host If you are developing on a linux machine, you may need to make a change to the xdebug configuration file.
