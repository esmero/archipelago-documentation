# Archipelago Commons Intro

Archipelago Commons, or simply Archipelago, is an evolving Open Source Digital Objects Repository / DAM Server Architecture based on the popular CMS [`Drupal8/9`](https://www.drupal.org) and released under [`GLP V.3 License`](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt).

Archipelago is a mix of deeply integrated custom-coded Drupal modules (made with care by us) and a curated and well-configured Drupal instance, running under a discrete and well-planned set of service containers.

Archipelago was dreamt as a multi-tenant, distributed, capable system (as its name suggests!) and can live isolated or in flocks of similar deployments, sharing storage, services, or -- even better -- just the discovery layer. Learn more about the different [`Software Services`](devops.md) used by Archipelago.

Archipelago's primary focus is to serve the greater [`GLAM community`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry_sector)) by providing a flexible, consistent, and unified way of describing, storing, linking, exposing metadata and media assets. We respect identities and existing workflows. We endeavor to design Archipelago in ways that empower communities of every size and shape.

Finally, Archipelago tries to stay humble, slim, and nimble in nature with a small code base full of inline comments and `@todos`. All of our work is driven by a clear and [concise but thoughtful planned technical roadmap --updated in tandem with new releases](https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-deployment/issues/103).
