# Strawberryfield Formatters

This documentation will give a brief overview of Archipelago's [Strawberryfield Formatters](https://github.com/esmero/format_strawberryfield) and how they work using the default View mode `Digital Object Full View` as an example.

## At a glance
When taking a look at your [First Digital Object](https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-documentation/blob/1.0.0-RC1/docs/firstobject.md) note that multiple formatters are working together to create this `Display` ( or `View mode`). Since "*My First Digital Object*" is a `Photograph` the `Display` being used is `Digital Object Full View` which, by default, uses formatters to:

- (**Red**) Create the image viewer where users can zoom in, zoom out, fullscreen and rotate all the images associated with the ADO.
- (**Blue**) Display the `Object Description` and `Type of Resource`.
- (**Green**) Display the Raw JSON Metadata and IIIF Presentation Manifest.

## In Greater Detail

When editing an ADO, at the top of the Webform page there is a tab titled `Manage display` which will take us to where all the Formatters live. _Take note that the `DISPLAY SETTINGS` shown in the screenshot below are using the **Default** View mode._

![Display Settings](images/strawberryfield-formatters/02_managedisplay.jpg)

Once the page loads the `Default` View mode is automatically selected. However, because we are editing an object with the `Media type` `Photograph`, we need to edit the View mode `Digital Object Full View` since it is the *Default* View mode for this `Media type`.

#### How to find and configure which View mode is Default per Media type

The **ADO Type to View mode Mapping** page tells the ADOs which View mode to use by default per Media type. This page can be accessed at `yoursite//admin/config/archipelago/viewmode_mapping`

![Selecting Digital Object Full View](images/strawberryfield-formatters/03_default-managedisplay.jpg)

There are two sections in `Manage display` for `Digital Object Full View`: 1) **Content** and 2) **Disabled**. Moving a field into **Content** means this formatter will be used to the display the ADO in some way. The formatters moved to **Disabled** are inactive and are subsequently not being used for displaying the ADO.

There are four fields named `üçìStrawberry` and each one is a copy of the field `üçìStrawberry (Descriptive Metadata source)`. Since the names of the fields do not imply their function, they have been named *Strawberry* in four different ways (Italiano, Deutsch, Din√© Bizaad, and English) in order to organize and help users visually remember which field is doing what for the `Display`.

Recall *My First Digital Object* at beginning of this document where there were 3 sections highlighted in **Red**, **Blue**, and **Green**.

- In **Red** (`üçìFragola`) there is the [Strawberry Field Formatter for IIIF media](tbd.md) which takes the image stored in S3 to display the photograph with the image viewer.
- In **Blue** (`üçìErdbeere`) there is the [Strawberry Field Formatter for Custom Metadata Templates](tbd.md) which displays the raw JSON metadata using configurable Twig templates. In this example, the default Twig template uses the JSON key `type` to display the `Type of Resource`.
- In **Green** (`üçìStrawberry (Descriptive Metadata)`) there is the [Strawberry Default Formatter](tbd.md) which is used to display the Raw JSON Metadata.

## At the end of the day
The decision for how your metadata is displayed is totally in your control.

Under the `WIDGET` column, there is a quick description/overview of what the formatter is doing.

And by clicking on the gear icon under the `OPERATIONS` column, all of the options for configuring the formatter are revealed. To use `üçìFragola` as an example (the Formatter for IIIF media), we can choose which JSON Key is being used to fetch the IIIF Media URLs (found inside the raw JSON being played with `Strawberry Default Formatter`), the maximum height and width of the viewer, etc.

And then with `üçìErdbeere` (the Formatter for Custom Metadata Templates) there is the option, among many others, to configure which Twig template the formatter will use for displaying your Metadata.
