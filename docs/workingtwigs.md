# Working with Twig in Archipelago

The following information can also be found in this Presentation from the "Twig Templates and Archipelago" Spring 2021 Workshop:
- [Twig Templates and Archipelago](http://tinyurl.com/archipelagoandtwig)

## Prequisites (with food analogy)

1. Know your Data/Metadata. What do I have? :thinking:
	- What do I have in my Fridge? Do I have Tofu? Do I have Peppermint :candy:? One Bunch?
2. Know your final desired output Document: MODS, HTML, GEOJSON, etc. 
	- What are you going to cook :cook:? Do you have a picture of the Curry :curry:? Have you ever had Curry :stew:?
3. Know your Twig Basics
	- How to cut and dice :knife:, steam and sauté :bowl_with_spoon:
4. Do not be afraid
	- You can’t get burned :fire: here and Ingredients :strawberry: do not expire!
5. Ask for help. Slack/Google Groups/Postcards :email: :mailbox_with_mail:
	- Seeing others cook helps and also motivates. Others may share some spices. :hot_pepper:
6. Use and Share your findings!
	- Eat what you cook. :cookie: Share with friends and family. :cake:

        "date_created": "1910-01-01"
    }
    ```

## First: Know Your Data

Understanding the basic structure of your JSON data. 

1. Single JSON Value.

	![KnowYourData1](images/KnowYourData1.png)
	- For `"type": "Photograph"`
		- "type" = JSON Key or Property
		- "Photograph" = Single JSON Value (string)

2. Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of **Strings**)

	![KnowYourData2](images/KnowYourData2.png)
	- For `"language": ["English","Spanish"]`
		- "language" = JSON Key or Property
		- "["English","Spanish"]" = Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of **Strings**)

3. Multiple JSON Values	(Array of Enumeration of **Objects**)

	![KnowYourData3](images/KnowYourData3.png)
	- For `"subject_loc":[{"uri":"http://..","label":"Dogs"},{"uri":"http://..","label":"Pets"}]`
		- "subject_loc" = JSON Key or Property
		- [{"uri":"http://..","label":"Dogs"},{"uri":"http://..","label":"Pets"}] =
			- **Object** with two JSON Keys. Each one with a single Value
			- Multiple JSON Values (Array of Enumeration of **Objects**)

## Getting Started with the Twig Language in Archipelago

- **Data** is known as **Context** in Twig Lingo.

- **All your** JSON Strawberryfield Metadata is accessible inside a Variable named _data_ in your twig template. 

- You can access the _values_ by using `data DOT Property (attribute) Name`.
	- In the Laddie the Dog example shown above:
		- `data.type` will contain "Photograph"
		- `data.language` will contain [ "English" ]
		- `data.language[0]` will contain "English" 
			- 0 means first entry in an Array or Enumeration
		- `data.subject_loc` will contain [{ "uri":"http…","label": "Dog" }]
		- `data.subject_loc.uri` will contain `"http://id.loc.gov/…"`
		- `data.subject_loc.label` will contain "Dog"

- Please note: you also have access to other info in your **context** `node`: such as`node.id` is the Drupal ID of your Current ADO; Also `is_front`, `language`, `is_admin`, `logged_in` and more!

#### Twig Statements and Printing 
- https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html
- Simple examples using Printing Statements
	- Single JSON Value Example:
		- Twig template: 
		 ```twig
		 Hello I am a {{ data.type }} and very happy to meet you
		 ````
		- Rendered output:
			- `Hello I am a Photograph and very happy to meet you`
	- Multiple JSON Values Example:
		- Twig template:
		```twig
		Hello I was classified as "{{ data.subject_loc.label }}" and very happy to meet you
		````
		- Rendered Output:
			- `Hello I was classified as "Dogs" and very happy to meet you`

#### Twig Statements and Executing
- https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/if.html
- Rendered Output based upon different Twig `conditionals`, `operators`, `tests`, `assignments`, and `filters`

- Example 1:
	- Twig template:
		```twig
		{% if data.subject_loc is defined %}
		Hey I have a Subject Key
		{% else %}
		Ups no Subject Key
		{% endif %}
		```
	- Rendered Output:
		- `Hey I have a Subject Key`
	- Conditionals, Operator, and Test usage:
		- **If/else** are conditionals
		- **is** is an operator
		- **defined** is a test	

- Example 2:
	- Twig template:
		```twig
		`{% for key, subject in data.subject_loc %}
		* Subject {{ subject.label }} found at position {{ key }}
		{% endfor %}`
		````
	- Rendered Output:
		- `* Subject Dogs found at position 0`
	- Loop usage:	
		- **for** is a loop
		- Inside the loop you have access to **key**, **subject**

- Example 3
	- Twig template:
		```twig
		`{% for subject in data.subject_loc %}
		{% set label_lowercase = subject.label|lower %}
		My lower case Subject is {{ label_lowercase }}
		{% endfor %}`
		````
	- Rendered Output:
		- `My lower case Subject is dogs`
	- Assignment, Filter, and Loop uage:	
		- **set** is an assignment 
		- | is a pipe, used after a value to apply a **filter**.
		- **lower** is a filter
		- Inside the loop you have have access to **subject** and **label_lowercase**

- Example 4:
	- Twig template: 
	```twig
	{% for subject in data.subject_loc %}
	  {% set label_lowercase = subject.label|lower %}
	My lower case Subject is {{ label_lowercase }}
	{% endfor %}
	{# 
	 This won’t display because it was assigned inside 
	 The For Loop
	#}
	{{ label_lowercase }}
	```
	- Rendered Output:
		- `My lower case Subject is dogs`

### Full Examples for Common Uses Cases:

**Use case #1:** I have multiple LoD Subjects and want to display them in my page as a clickable ordered list but i’m a safe/careful person.

**Twig Example for Use Case #1:**
```twig
{% if data.subject_loc is iterable and data.subject_loc is not empty %}
<h2>My Subjects</h2>
<ul>
   {% for subject in data.subject_loc %}
   <li>
      <a href="{{ subject.uri }}" title="{{ subject.label|capitalize }}" target="_blank">
      {{ subject.label }}
      </a>
   </li> 
   {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
```
**Use case #2:** I have sometimes a publication date. I want to show it in beautiful human readable language.

**Twig Example for Use Case #2:**
```twig
{% if data.date_published is not empty %}
<h2>Date {{ data.label }} was published:</h2>
<p>
{{ data.date_published|date("F jS \\o\\f Y \\a\\t g:ia") }}
</p>
{% endif %}
```
**Note about `date` in this Use Case #2 Twig Example:** 
- **date()** is a function
- It uses a [“Date Format Pattern”](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php) as argument.

**Use Case #3 (Full Curry):** {# May 4th 2021 @dpino: I have sometimes a user provided creation date. I want to show it in beautiful human readable language but fallback to automatic date if absent. I also want in the last case to show it was either “created” or “updated”. #}
```json
    "as:generator": {
        "type": "Update",
        "actor": {
            "url": "https:\/\/archipelago.nyc\/form\/descriptive-metadata",
            "name": "descriptive_metadata",
            "type": "Service"
        },
        "endTime": "2021-03-17T13:24:01-04:00",
        "summary": "Generator",
        "@context": "https:\/\/www.w3.org\/ns\/activitystreams"
    }
```

**Twig Example for Use Case #3:**
```twig
{% if data.date_created is not empty %}
<h2>Date {{ data.label }} was created:</h2>
<p>
  {{ data.date_created|date("F jS \\o\\f Y \\a\\t g:ia") }}
</p>
{% else %}
<h2>Date {{ data.label }} was {{ attribute(data, 'as:generator').type|lower }}d  in this repository:</h2>
<p>
  {{  attribute(data, 'as:generator').endTime|date("F jS \\o\\f Y \\a\\t g:ia") }}
</p>
{% endif %}
```

### A Recommended Workflow

You want to create a New Metadata Display(HTML) or a new (XML) Schema based format?

1. Get yourself an example **document (Frame)**. If **HTML** copy the source. If **XML** copy the full XML thing (cmd+c)
2. Create a new **Metadata Display Entity**. Copy the content (text) of your Frame into the Edit window (cmd+v)
3. Select an existing (as complete as possible) ADO to use as preview, press Preview
4. Put your nice glasses :nerd_face: on. What do you see? What data in your Frame do you have in your ADO (data)?
5. Start nimble. Selected the `data.label` info, check where your **Frame** uses a _Title_ or a _Label_. Remove that text (cmd+x) and replace with a ``{{ data.label }}``. Press Preview. Do you see your title?
6. Keep doing **6**, over and over. Leave complex values for the end. (e.g `data.subject_loc`)
7. Document your changes `{# I added this because .. #}`
8. Save

Once the Template is in place you can use it in a _Formatter_, as _Endpoint_, in your _Search Results_ or just keep it around until you and the world are ready!
